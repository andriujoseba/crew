# install-drill.sh — Section A of the release rehearsal.
#
# The offline install and artifact assertions stay in their CI harnesses. This
# driver invokes them, then adds the observations a CI harness cannot make:
# switch skew, hire/skip from a git-less install, no box-side crew repository,
# full-uninstall refusal, and engine survival after the console is removed —
# each of which requires a real box. It also builds a real offline artifact and
# installs it here, and measures what every tree it installs actually holds
# (install-payload.sh, #421): that measurement needs no box, but it does need
# the real installs and the real unpack this driver already performs.
#
# It borrows a box the role rehearsal installed, and gives it back unchanged:
# its fixture roster is built from the identity that box already carries, so
# the hires below are version events, never identity events. An unhired box
# has no identity to preserve, and is the one case where this drill picks one.

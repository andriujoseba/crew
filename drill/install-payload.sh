# install-payload.sh — #365's payload rule, asserted on an INSTALLED tree, for
# drill/install-drill.sh. The caller supplies pass() and fail(); keeping the
# predicate here makes every one of its failure paths fixture-testable without
# a box host, the way install-survival.sh does for step 9.
#
# Section A installs, upgrades and packs real trees on a real host, and until
# now never looked at what any of them held. #365 shrank an installed tree from
# 32M — 29M of it fleet-floor/dev — to under the bound below, and a regression
# there is silent in a way the offline suites cannot catch for the channels
# only a host runs end to end: the tree installs, every assertion passes, and
# the fleet carries 30M again per box per `crew upgrade`.
#
# NOTHING HERE SPELLS THE RULE ITSELF. Both halves are read from the tree under
# drill, which install-drill.sh already requires to carry all three files:
#   * the excluded roots, from install.sh's PAYLOAD_EXCLUDED_PATHS — the one
#     list install.sh derives both its tar excludes and prune_payload() from,
#     and the one an installed tree ships, so the drill and the installer can
#     never disagree about what "excluded" means;
#   * the size bound, from the two offline guards that already enforce it.
# A second copy under drill/ would drift, which is the rule this repo already
# applies to the panel roster (#356) and to the queue-label set.

# The bound, in KiB, read from the guards that own it. BOTH spell it today, so
# reading both and requiring agreement costs nothing and turns that existing
# duplication into a checked invariant: two different numbers is a defect in
# the guards, and a drill that picked one of them arbitrarily would hide it.

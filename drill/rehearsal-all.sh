# Three single-role boxes, not one multi-role box: fleet.roster deploys
# single-role members, and duty.sh gates every module on has_role. A box
# carrying all three would exercise a composite path nobody runs, and would
# hide exactly the class of defect that made a reviewer box quietly run
# triage sweeps for a whole rehearsal (heavy-duty/crew#28).
#
# The three boxes may share ONE gh identity. That is safe only because
# repos.txt is the scope for every module (heavy-duty/crew#7's doctrine
# change) and each box gets its own sandbox — disjoint registries, disjoint
# work. Under the previous org-wide review sweep all three would have seen
# each other's PRs and raced for the same verdicts.
#
# Each role runs to completion before the next starts. They are NOT
# parallelised: the boxes share an identity, and a shared identity means
# shared rate limits and interleaved duty.log evidence that nobody can read.

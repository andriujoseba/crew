# `tick.sh` takes the box's `flock` with `-n` and, when a previous run still
# holds it, logs one line and exits (shared/bin/tick.sh:85-90). A skipped tick
# returns immediately, so this leg's back-to-back loop spends its whole budget
# inside two seconds: in the 0.1.3-rc2 round the reviewer role's dispatch 1
# landed and the five ticks after it were all lock-skips, logged between
# 15:54:29Z and 15:54:31Z. Each of those slices was then graded as lane
# behaviour, and the lane was reported broken.
#
# That slice says nothing about the lane in either direction. It is the third
# state the census groups in rehearsal-safety.sh are about, on the tick rather
# than on the log: not "the lane did not trip" and not "the lane tripped", but
# "nothing was asked of it". The leg waits and re-fires instead of grading it,
# and when the bound is spent it says INCOMPLETE with the reason — never FAIL
# against a lane it never reached.
#
# The diagnostic the message reads is #726's, and is deliberately NOT repaired
# here: this leg's job is to stop grading a tick that did not run, whatever the
# holder turns out to have been.

# Which of tick.sh's evidence shapes this slice carries. The contract at the
# top of shared/bin/tick.sh guarantees exactly one line per boundary, in one of
# three shapes, and silence is itself a fourth reading:
#
#   <ts> duty run start          — the tick RAN (written by duty.sh:61)
#   <ts> duty tick skipped: ...  — the lock refused it        -> `locked`
#   <ts> duty tick FAILED: ...   — the job exited non-zero    -> `failed`
#   (nothing)                    — the invocation never landed -> `silent`
#
# Absence of the lock-skip line is NOT evidence that a tick ran: an invocation
# that failed, or a log that could not be read, produces a slice that carries
# no line at all, and grading that as lane behaviour is this issue's defect
# with the tick in place of the fixture. So the leg reads the POSITIVE mark.
#
# `failed` is checked before `run start` deliberately. tick.sh writes FAILED
# after the job has usually already written its own start record
# (shared/lib/common/tick-health.sh:60), so the pair means the job began and
# then aborted: that slice is a partial run, and a lane graded on it is graded
# on however far the job got. INCOMPLETE with the reason named is the honest
# reading, and it is the safe direction — never a FAIL against an engine the
# tick never reached.

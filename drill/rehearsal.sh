# drill/rehearsal.sh — the duty-engine rehearsal as one host-side script.
#
# Run on a box HOST (box + rig installed), from a crew checkout:
#
#   drill/rehearsal.sh [--agent <name>] [--box <name>]
#     [--tree <clean-git-checkout>]
#     [--remote <url>] [--ref <git-ref>] [--source-ref <git-ref>]
#     [--sandbox <owner/repo>] [--quick]
#
# --source-ref is for an orchestrator, not the operator: it records the ref the
# operator named where --ref carries the commit that ref resolved to, so the
# exit footer can still say which pull request to report on.
#
# Phase 1 (pre-auth) runs unconditionally: install the engine in the drill
# box as the selected agent (claude by default) in the reviewer role and
# verify every creds-free behavior. Phase 2 runs automatically IF the box's
# gh and selected-agent CLIs are authenticated (the
# operator logs the box in between runs; the script never touches
# credentials): it mints its own GitHub fixtures — a sandbox repo under the
# HOST's gh identity, a collaborator invite the box accepts itself, an
# attention-labelled issue, a scratch PR with a review request — and
# verifies the attention wake, the review round through both one-shot
# gates, head dedup, the re-request auto-approve, and gate abuse.
#
# Every check prints `ok <name>` or `FAIL <name>`; the script exits
# non-zero if anything failed. Fixtures and the drill box are LEFT IN
# PLACE for inspection, and the box is always left disarmed with its
# pre-drill repo registry restored. Removing them is `drill/teardown.sh`,
# which rehearsal-all.sh runs for you after a green round; a re-run against
# a box that is still standing REFUSES unless you pass --reuse (#217).
#
# Companion prose: shared/docs/rehearsal.md (what each check means and why).
# shellcheck disable=SC2088  # tildes in bx "…" strings expand in the BOX's
# login shell, which is exactly where those paths live

BOX_NAME=""
# The tracked mainline, not a fork branch. These defaulted to
# dan-claude-bot/crew @ crew/shared-duty — the #16 development branch — so long
# after that work merged the drill still rehearsed a fork's stale branch by
# default, and an operator running `drill/rehearsal.sh` with no flags tested
# code that was not what the fleet deploys. Pass --tree/--remote/--ref to
# override; --tree is what you want when drilling a clean git checkout.

# The ref the OPERATOR named, when an orchestrator resolved it before passing
# it down. rehearsal-all.sh fetches the operator's ref to one commit and hands
# every role that commit, so that three roles cannot straddle a moving branch
# (#490) — which also means $REF is a bare SHA by the time this script prints
# anything, and a SHA names no pull request. --source-ref carries the shape
# that does. Empty for a standalone run, where $REF is already the operator's.

# box, and both name the agent the round was given — never a name spelled
# here (#427).
#
# The authenticated arm only, and the two rows partition on GH_AUTHED
# together. On a creds-free box `cli probe: FAILED` is the CORRECT verdict
# (shared/docs/rehearsal.md, "one boot block"), so the probe row has no defect
# to assert there. The WARN-free row skips for a reason of a different kind:
# that block is a known-degraded boot whose FAILED probe the row above has
# just declined to vouch for, so a WARN-free green read off it would be a pass
# reported about a boot no other row in the arm stands behind.
#
# Neither reason is the login WARN asserted below. That WARN goes to
# ~/duty/duty.log, which is the file `pre-auth: login WARN logged` reads — a
# different file from the ~/duty/boot-check.log these two read, so no
# contradiction between the rows was ever possible (#427 §5, measured by
# triage 2026-08-09). They fire on the operator's re-run, once the box is
# logged in — the same box state every other assertion in this block

  # -- what the flag actually gates, reached deliberately --
  # AUTO_APPROVE_REREQUEST=0 disables the auto-APPROVAL and nothing else
  # (#151): a re-request newer than my standing verdict still queues a REAL
  # re-review at an unchanged head. instance.conf is sourced after fleet.conf,
  # so appending the flag overrides it for this box.
  #
  # This probe used to assert the opposite — that auto=0 fell to the skip
  # branch — and grepped duty.log for "already covers head". That was never a
  # guarantee, it was the bug: the flag sat in front of rereq_decision's whole
  # timestamp comparison, so a standing block plus a newer re-request answered
  # `skip` every tick and the round could not converge (ceremony#207, 37
  # minutes, cleared by hand). Post-fix the branch is unreachable from here for
  # the same reason the announce half above stopped grepping for it: `skip`
  # needs NO re-request newer than my verdict, and requested_reviewers
  # self-clears on submit, so a covered PR becomes a candidate again only BY a
  # re-request, which is newer by construction.
  #
  # The queue holds for APPROVED, CHANGES_REQUESTED and DISMISSED alike, so the
  # probe stays deterministic without staging a particular verdict first — the
  # reviewer's own considered verdict above is whatever it is.

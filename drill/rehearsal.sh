# drill/rehearsal.sh — the duty-engine rehearsal as one host-side script.
#
# Run on a box HOST (box + rig installed), from a crew checkout:
#
#   drill/rehearsal.sh [--agent <name>] [--box <name>]
#     [--tree <clean-git-checkout>]
#     [--remote <url>] [--ref <git-ref>] [--sandbox <owner/repo>] [--quick]
#
# Phase 1 (pre-auth) runs unconditionally: install the engine in the drill
# box as the selected agent (claude by default) in the reviewer role and
# verify every creds-free behavior. Phase 2 runs automatically IF the box's
# gh and selected-agent CLIs are authenticated (the
# operator logs the box in between runs; the script never touches
# credentials): it mints its own GitHub fixtures — a sandbox repo under the
# HOST's gh identity, a collaborator invite the box accepts itself, an
# attention-labelled issue, a scratch PR with a review request — and
# verifies the attention wake, the review round through both one-shot
# gates, head dedup, the re-request auto-approve, and gate abuse.
#
# Every check prints `ok <name>` or `FAIL <name>`; the script exits
# non-zero if anything failed. Fixtures and the drill box are LEFT IN
# PLACE for inspection, and the box is always left disarmed with its
# pre-drill repo registry restored. Removing them is `drill/teardown.sh`,
# which rehearsal-all.sh runs for you after a green round; a re-run against
# a box that is still standing REFUSES unless you pass --reuse (#217).
#
# Companion prose: shared/docs/rehearsal.md (what each check means and why).

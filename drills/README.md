# Drill records

Per-release evidence for crew's duty-engine rehearsal. **One file per
version**, named for the version exactly as `VERSION` carries it:

    drills/<version>.md

So `0.1.0` is recorded in `drills/0.1.0.md`, and `0.1.0-rc1` in
`drills/0.1.0-rc1.md`. They are different files, which is the whole point: the
filesystem does the whole-version comparison, so a record for a candidate can
never be mistaken for evidence for the final.

The directory is `drills/`, not `.drills/` — a dot-directory is invisible to
any glob without `dotglob`, which is how the fleet's siblings shipped releases
with records a sweep could not see.

**This directory is the record, not the instrument.** The instrument is
[`drill/rehearsal.sh`](../drill/rehearsal.sh) and its companions
(`rehearsal-all.sh`, `rehearsal-app.sh`, `rehearsal-config.sh`,
`rehearsal-safety.sh`): they install the engine in a drill box on a real host
and exercise the duty lifecycle end to end. crew does not reach into another
repo's harness to decide whether crew may ship — a cross-repo lookup that fails
silently degrades to "pass". The gate reads a file in this repo, and nothing
else.

## What the gate requires

The `drill-recorded` guard (heavy-duty/ceremony's action, pinned through
`.github/workflows/release.yml`) runs on every PR. On a `-dev` tree it asserts
nothing — a development tree has no release to evidence. On a bare `VERSION` — a
release ceremony tree — it requires `drills/<version>.md` to exist and to hold
at least one non-whitespace character. An empty file, or one of only spaces and
tabs, is not a record.

The guard requires a **record**, not a passing result. A maintainer waiver is a
legitimate outcome of a release — but it is written in that version's file, so
that skipping the drill is a deliberate, reviewable commit rather than a
silence. **A failed drill is still a valid record**: the gate wants evidence,
not success.

Every declared leg must appear in the round summary as either executed or not
executed with a named reason. The declared-leg inventory in
`drill/rehearsal-all.sh` is checked against the detailed summary at runtime;
adding a leg without wiring one result, or wiring a result without declaring
the leg, makes the mismatch a red record row. An operator-requested exclusion
names its flag, while a discovered blocker names the missing prerequisite. A
leg must never be absent from the record. The selected triage, builder and
reviewer rows describe round participants rather than independently runnable
legs, so they remain in the detailed summary outside this inventory.

## The rc ladder

**A release candidate carries its own drill record.** The ladder is
[`.ceremony/RELEASES.md`](../.ceremony/RELEASES.md)'s, adopted here and not
varied from: `X.Y.Z-dev` → `X.Y.Z-rc1` → `X.Y.Z-rc2-dev` → `X.Y.Z-rc2` → … →
`X.Y.Z`. Each candidate is a tag-only cut whose ceremony PR changes `VERSION`
to the bare `X.Y.Z-rcN` and adds `drills/X.Y.Z-rcN.md`, leaving `CHANGELOG.md`
and every fragment untouched; the doors publish it with `--prerelease` and the
merge door re-arms `main` as `X.Y.Z-rc(N+1)-dev`. One file per version is the
rule stated at the top of this file, and it is what makes the ladder cost
nothing to gate: `drills/0.9.0-rc1.md` and `drills/0.9.0.md` are different
paths, so `drill-recorded` asks the same question of a candidate that it asks
of a final and needs no rc-specific case.

**What the ladder buys is downstream.** A long window otherwise re-drills at
every rebase, because the drilled tree moves under the record. Drill the
candidate once, publish it as a tag, and the final's evidence anchors to an
immutable published ref instead of to a tree that has since changed.

**What it does not buy, stated so this is not read as more than it is:** the
first rc round still drills a *mutable* candidate. `drill-recorded` gates the
rc PR, so `drills/X.Y.Z-rc1.md` must exist before the merge that creates the
`X.Y.Z-rc1` tag — the record is committed against a tree that is not yet
tagged. That is heavy-duty/crew#490's problem, and it is unchanged here.

### The stamps-only test

The ladder's claim is that **the drilled tree and the shipped tree differ by no
executable byte**. That claim is checkable, so it is checked rather than
asserted: at a final release tree, the diff from the last `X.Y.Z-rcN` tag to
`HEAD` must touch **stamps only**.

A stamp is release furniture — the four paths a ceremony PR is allowed to move,
and no others:

| stamp | what moves it |
| --- | --- |
| `VERSION` | the rc cut, the re-arm, and the final cut |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | the final's assembled section |
| `changelog.d/**` | the fragments that section consumed |
| `drills/**` | the version's own record |

Anything else in that diff means work landed between the candidate and the
final, so the tree that ships is not the tree that was drilled and **the ladder
has not been followed**. Two ways forward, both ordinary: cut `X.Y.Z-rc(N+1)` at
the tree that actually ships and drill *that*, so the final rides a candidate it
does not differ from; or take the non-stamp change back out of this release
window. Neither is an exception to the gate — the first satisfies it and the
second removes what it objected to.

**Drilling the final itself is not a third way out of that refusal**, and this
section said it was. Once a candidate is published and in the final's own
history it stays the anchor, so writing a fresh `drills/X.Y.Z.md` adds a stamp
and removes neither the anchor nor the stray path. Drilling only the final is
what an **un-laddered** window does, and there the guard is vacuous because no
candidate sits above the final to compare it against — a different shape of
window, not a remedy for this one. The ladder stays available and never
required (heavy-duty/crew#506 D5); what is not available is starting it and
then stepping off it.

**The test is deliberately stricter than the sentence it enforces.** "No
executable byte" would let a documentation-only merge through; the stamp set
refuses it. The asymmetry is the reason: a false red costs one author a
re-read and is answered by cutting the next candidate, while a false green
ships a final whose evidence describes a tree nobody ran. A guard that is
looser than its claim is the claim wearing a green check.

`.github/stamps-only.py` is that guard, run on every PR from
[`.github/workflows/release-guards.yml`](../.github/workflows/release-guards.yml)
beside the ceremony gates. It is vacuous on a `-dev` tree, on an rc tree — an
`rc2` exists precisely *because* something changed, so there is nothing for it
to assert — and on a final whose window cut no candidate. Its contract tests
are `.github/stamps-only.test.sh`.

**Which candidate was last is read from two sources, and neither is trusted
alone.** The anchor is the highest-numbered of the `drills/X.Y.Z-rcN.md`
records in the shipped tree *and* the `X.Y.Z-rcN` tags reachable from `HEAD`,
because each source fails open where the other holds:

- The records are **deletable by the diff under examination**. A record lives
  in `drills/`, a stamp path, so removing it in the final commit is admitted by
  the stamp set — and a records-only anchor would drop with it, reporting a
  window that laddered nothing while engine code sat in the diff.
- The tags **cannot tell a tag never fetched from a tag never cut**, so a
  tags-only anchor would read a shallow clone as an un-laddered release.

So the guard refuses in both directions. A record whose tag cannot be resolved
is a **refusal and never a pass** — "I found nothing" and "I could not look"
are different answers here for the same reason they are in teardown's exit
table below — and a candidate that is published and in this final's own history
but carries **no record in the shipped tree** is refused too. The retention
matters because the record is the only thing that says *what* was drilled: a tag
that has lost its record has lost its evidence, and un-publishing is not what
deleting a file does.

That check reads **every** reachable candidate and not only the one the final is
measured against. The ladder is `rc1 → rc2 → … → X.Y.Z`, so a window with more
than one rung is the ordinary case, and each rung's record is the only
description of the tree that rung ran. Deleting a record *below* the anchor
cannot move the anchor — the highest number is unchanged when a lower one leaves
— so it is not a way past the stamps-only test; what it destroys is the
evidence, which is the thing the ladder exists to keep. **Restoring the record
is the only thing that answers this refusal**, and it is recoverable exactly,
because the record is in the candidate's own tree: `git checkout X.Y.Z-rcN --
drills/X.Y.Z-rcN.md`. Cutting the next candidate does *not* answer it — that
tag stays reachable and stays recordless, and the guard refuses again.

The guard asks the candidate's tree for that record before offering the
checkout, rather than promising it. A candidate that published with **no record
at all** — which `drill-recorded` gates the rc PR precisely to prevent, so it
takes a hand edit to reach — has nothing to check out, and there the refusal
says to *write* `drills/X.Y.Z-rcN.md`: a record written late is still the only
description of that tree, and the gate takes a waiver honestly stated.

**And what retention asks for is the tag's own spelling, not its number.**
`drill-recorded` computes the record's path as `drills/$ver.md` from the version
being cut, so a candidate published as `0.9.0-rc1` carries `drills/0.9.0-rc1.md`
and nothing else can stand in for it. A final that *renames* that record to
`drills/0.9.0-rc01.md` has deleted the published evidence — the rename lives
inside `drills/`, so the stamp set admits it, and a check keyed on the number
would see candidate 1 still recorded and pass. It is the deletion above wearing
a rename, and it is refused as one, naming both the record that is required and
the file that stands in for it.

**One number, one spelling.** `version_is_rc` at the pin is
`X.Y.Z-rc[0-9]+`, which accepts a zero-padded number, and `version_next_dev`
re-arms `0.9.0-rc01` as `0.9.0-rc2-dev`. So `0.9.0-rc01` is a candidate the
release doors publish, and the guard reads the number only to *order* the
ladder: every tag it resolves and every record it names is the spelling that is
actually on disk. Where one number is spelled two ways in one ladder — two
records, or two tags both in the final's history — the guard says so and stops,
because an arbitrary anchor is a measurement against a tree nobody declared. The
one place two spellings of a number are not ambiguous but simply wrong is
retention, just above: a published candidate's record is spelled exactly as its
tag, so the other spelling is not a second candidate to disambiguate — it is the
record renamed.

**A shallow clone is a "could not look" wherever it touches this guard**, and
that includes ancestry. A `--depth 1` checkout that *has* fetched the tags can
resolve `X.Y.Z-rcN` and still answer no to `merge-base --is-ancestor`, because
the join is below the graft: the no is about the clone and not about the tree.
Refusing there would print the guard's loudest sentence — that what ships only
resembles what was drilled — over a clone that simply cannot see. So it exits
`2` and names the fix (`actions/checkout` with `fetch-depth: 0`), which is the
same answer it gives when a record's tag cannot be resolved at all. CI fetches
full history, so this is a local-clone corner; keeping the two answers apart is
the point.

A candidate tagged on a line the final does not descend from is **not** the
anchor. It drilled a different lineage, and reading it would red a window it
has nothing to say about — while a candidate the final *does* descend from is
exactly the one whose record cannot be allowed to vanish.

## Adapting the drill to the window

**A release window's drill is adapted to what that window shipped, and the
release issue carries the audit that says so.** At release-init, triage adds one
row for every surface shipped by the fragments in `changelog.d/` on `main` when
the release issue is minted, naming the issue and surface and assigning exactly
one disposition.
Every fragment contributes at least one row; a fragment that ships more than
one surface contributes a row for each:

- **`drilled`** — an existing leg reads the surface; name the assertion.
- **`new leg`** — the window needs another leg; name the issue minted for it.
- **`not a drill surface`** — no real-host assertion belongs in this drill;
  state why. An empty reason leaves the audit incomplete.

Those three dispositions are exhaustive. `Partly drilled` is not a fourth: it
means a fragment shipped separate surfaces that need separate rows.

The audit is a table in the release issue, not another repository file. Triage
owns it because release-init already reads the window membership, and completes
it then so every required leg can land before the operator runs the round. A
leg that lands after the drill round changes the candidate the record describes
and forces a re-drill.

### Worked example: `0.1.2`

This is a worked example at snapshot
`07bb0f3473d1a35a39fdf8d9ab93ac7d99ec3d74`, not `0.1.2`'s audit of record.
Its fragment names are exactly the 42 fragments returned by
`git ls-tree -r --name-only 07bb0f3473d1a35a39fdf8d9ab93ac7d99ec3d74 -- changelog.d/`,
excluding `changelog.d/README.md`. Triage re-derives the audit of record at
release-init against the actual cut. The owed `425.md`, `427.md`, `440.md`,
and `441.md` fragments are absent at this snapshot and therefore have no rows
below. A disposition records the decision at audit time, so a `new leg` row
keeps the issue it caused even when that issue has since landed.

## The drill

crew asserts the **duty lifecycle** — that the engine, installed on a real box,
runs its roles correctly. box asserts the isolation contract, rig asserts
convergence, cast asserts promotion; crew asserts that a fleet of agents does
triage, build and review the way the doctrine says. The legs
(`drill/rehearsal.sh`, run per role by `rehearsal-all.sh`):

- **Phase 1, creds-free.** Install the engine into a drill box as the selected
  agent in each role, and verify every behavior that needs no credentials —
  a box comes up disarmed and reports so.
- **Phase 2, authenticated** (runs when the box's `gh` and agent CLIs are
  logged in — the operator logs the box in between runs; the harness never
  touches credentials). It mints its own GitHub fixtures under the host
  identity and verifies the attention wake, the review round through both
  one-shot gates, head dedup, the re-request auto-approve, and gate abuse.
- **One box per role**, not one box carrying all three: `fleet.roster` deploys
  single-role members and `duty.sh` gates every module on `has_role`, so a
  composite box would exercise a path nobody runs.
- **The console** (`fleet-floor`) is part of the rehearsal, not a separate
  errand: it is what an operator looks at to decide the fleet is healthy.
- **Operator-config convergence** — the registry contract exercised against a
  real installed box.

Within a run, fixtures and the drill box are left in place for inspection; the
box is always left disarmed and its pre-drill repo registry restored. What
happens to them *between* runs is the lifecycle below. Companion prose:
[`shared/docs/rehearsal.md`](../shared/docs/rehearsal.md).

## The round's lifecycle — create, reuse, teardown

A round is real infrastructure, and it is the operator's machine and the
operator's GitHub account that carry it.

**A round creates**, per role in `--roles` (all three by default):

- a **box** on the host, `crew-drill-<role>`, at 2 CPU / 4 GiB / 20 GiB;
- a **public sandbox repository**, `<host-gh-identity>/crew-drill-<role>`,
  which the round then fills with issues, PRs and review traffic.

**A green round tears itself down.** `rehearsal-all.sh` runs
[`drill/teardown.sh`](../drill/teardown.sh) when every leg passed, removing
both. Nothing else on the host is touched, ever:

    drill/teardown.sh [--roles "triage builder reviewer"] [--role <role>]
                      [--box <name>] [--sandbox <owner/repo>]
                      [--dry-run] [--yes]

It names every box and repository with its creation date and asks once
(`CREW_YES=1` or `--yes` for an unattended run), and it is idempotent — a
second run over a clean host reports nothing to do and exits zero. A name is
deletable only when it is **exactly** one of the drill's own names *and* is
named by no roster on this host: a roster member is refused even when its name
matches the drill pattern, and a name that merely starts with `crew-drill` is
not a drill box. A sandbox repository has the same two gates — the `<repo>`
half must be a drill name *and* the owner must be this host's `gh` identity,
since a round's sandboxes are always `<host-gh-identity>/crew-drill-<role>`.
Every target is validated before any is deleted, so a command carrying one bad
name removes nothing at all, and naming the same target twice deletes it once.

**"I found nothing" and "I could not look" are different answers**, and the
exit status is where teardown keeps them apart:

| exit | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | every class it was asked to clear was **inspected**, and whatever existed is gone. Only this means a clean host. |
| `1` | **refused** — a name outside the deletable set — or a deletion failed. |
| `2` | **INCOMPLETE** — a class could not be inspected at all, so what it holds is unknown and may still be standing. |

A run is INCOMPLETE when there is no `gh` identity to address the sandbox
repositories with, when there is no `box` CLI, when `box list --json` cannot
be read or parsed (no `jq` counts), or when a **single repository lookup**
does not answer. That last one is the same distinction at the other grain: an
identity that resolves says the API can be *asked*, not that it *answered*, so
a lookup that fails for anything other than a measured `HTTP 404` names its own
repository as uninspected rather than being counted absent. It says which class
or repository and why, it still deletes everything it *could* see — that half
of the host really is clean — and it does not report the round as done.
`rehearsal-all.sh` gives it its own `INCOMPLETE teardown` summary row rather
than `ok`, so a green round can never end with a cleanup line claiming more
than was measured.

One caveat worth knowing rather than discovering: GitHub answers `404` for a
private repository the token cannot see, so a measured absence is really
"absent *to this identity*". That is the API's shape, and it is the safe
direction — a repository this identity cannot see is not one it can delete.

A custom `--box` name is the operator's own and teardown will refuse it; the
rehearsal's reuse refusal says so rather than printing a teardown command that
cannot work.

**A round that did not pass keeps its boxes**, and so does `--keep`. A failed
leg is the case where you need the box standing to find out why, so the run
says the boxes are still there and prints the teardown command. `INCOMPLETE`
— phase 2 never ran — counts as not passing here for the same reason.

**Reuse is opt-in, and it weakens phase 1.** A rehearsal whose target box
already exists **refuses**, naming the box, its creation date, and the two ways
forward: tear it down, or pass `--reuse`. Reuse is legitimate when the operator
means it, but a box that is already `gh`-authenticated cannot prove the
creds-free half of phase 1 — the login WARN, the absent `.boot-id` marker and
the un-spawned sessions all SKIP. That is what happened to the `0.1.0` round
(#116), which is why the refusal is the default and why `--reuse` writes itself
into the run's output, at the point of reuse and again in the summary. **A
record of a reused round says so**, by carrying that line.

Deleting a box does not revoke the GitHub identity it logged into. Identity
lifecycle is a separate concern from drill fixtures, and teardown does not
touch it.

## What a record should contain

What ran, on what host, the pinned candidate ref, the numbers, and what failed.
Below is the *shape*, in a file named `drills/9.9.9.md` — a version that can
never collide with a real release. **No drill has been recorded here yet**;
this log starts empty rather than reconstructing runs from memory, since an
invented number is worse than no number.

```markdown
# Release drill — 9.9.9 — 2026-01-01

Run ID: drill-2026-01-01-a. Host: bare Debian 13 cloud image, box + rig
installed, 4 vCPU / 8 GB. Candidate ref: crew@1a2b3c4.

| Leg | Result |
| --- | --- |
| phase 1 — creds-free install, reviewer role, box disarmed | PASS |
| phase 2 — attention wake | PASS |
| phase 2 — review round through both one-shot gates | PASS |
| head dedup / re-request auto-approve | PASS |
| gate abuse refused | PASS |
| fleet-floor console (read-only) | PASS |
| operator-config convergence | clean, no changes |

Failed: nothing this run.
```

State what failed. A record with no failures listed reads as "nothing broke",
so if a leg was not run, say that instead of omitting it.

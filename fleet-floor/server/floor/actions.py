# --------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Fired into the box with `box exec`; the box initiates nothing.
#
# Each script states its own verdict on the last line and exits deliberately.
# It used to end on a bare `grep -c`, and `grep -c` exits 1 when it counts
# zero — so the count WAS the exit status, and a box with no armed `tick.sh`
# line reported the same rc 1 as a box that could not be reached. `in_box`
# read that as ok=False, `do_command` answered 500, and the console rendered
# it "command refused" (#188). Nothing was refusing: a count of zero was
# being reported as a failure, which is #176's shape — "nothing to do" and
# "it went wrong" collapsed into one status.
#
# Three outcomes, three answers: `paused N` (it took effect), `nothing to
# pause: ...` (rc 0, there was nothing armed), and a non-zero exit whose
# stderr says why. The counts travel as data on stdout; only a real failure
# is allowed to redden the row. Each write is checked on its own exit status
# rather than inferred from a later read, so a `crontab -` that refuses is
# named as the failure it is.
#
# N is the number of lines THIS call moved, not the number of lines now in
# the target state: a box carrying a `#CREW-FLOOR-PAUSED` line from an
# earlier pause, plus one armed line, pauses one line and says `paused 1`.
# Reporting the post-state total would say `paused 2` — an overcount on a
# control plane whose whole subject is saying what it actually did.
#
# That is also why the crontab is read ONCE, into `cron`, and the write is
# fed from that snapshot rather than from a second `crontab -l`: the counts
# and the text being rewritten are then the same crontab, so the delta check
# below means what it says. It costs one read rather than adding one.

    arms to it, because these share nothing with the arms around them: no
    `box exec`, no host verb, no per-box row, and — the reason it matters —
    NO REFRESH. Every other action changes what the fleet snapshot renders, so
    it ends by asking for a re-poll; a registry write changes two files on the

    will not accept, and nothing was written. That is a different thing from a
    box that was asked to do something and refused, which is what 500 means
    everywhere else in this module.

    AND IT IS A DIFFERENT THING AGAIN FROM AN EDIT THAT LANDED WITHOUT ITS

    false, and the result travels with it. Reporting that as a refusal would

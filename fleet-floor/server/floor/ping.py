# --- the ping tier ---------------------------------------------------------
#
# The evidence probe answers "what has this box been doing"; it reads ~600 log
# lines and cannot run often. "Is this box still answering" is a different and
# much cheaper question, and tying it to the evidence poll meant the fastest
# possible detection of a wedged guest was one full probe interval.
#
# `box exec <box> -- true` is the whole ping. Deliberately an EXEC and not a
# socket: a listening port is answered by the guest kernel, so it stays green
# through a userspace that can no longer fork. This round-trip needs the incus
# agent alive, a fork, an exec and a binary read off disk — it fails when the
# box is wedged, which is the entire point.
# Measured on the drill host: ~97ms wall, ~47ms host CPU per ping, and that
# 47ms is a FLOOR — `time` accounts only for children of the calling shell, so
# it excludes incusd's handling and the in-guest fork. At 10s across 7 boxes
# that is ~3% of a core. 1s would be ~33% for detection nothing downstream can
# act on.
#
# Two things this knob does NOT do, both of which make a smaller number a lie:
#   · values below 2 are silently ignored — ping_loop's sleep has a max(2, ...)
#     floor, so setting 1 buys nothing
#   · one wedged box paces the whole fleet — ping_once blocks until every
#     thread joins, up to PING_TIMEOUT_S + 5, so the configured interval is a
#     BEST case that degrades exactly when something is unhealthy
#
# The 97ms-normal against a 5000ms timeout is a 50x margin, and that is what
# makes PING_FAILS_TO_WEDGE=3 a wedge detector rather than a jitter detector.

# The ping already pays for a host-side process start (~47ms of the ~97ms);
# what runs INSIDE the guest is nearly free by comparison. So it reads two
# files on the way past, and STUCK detection moves from the 60s evidence tier
# to this one — a hung duty session is now seen ~6x sooner, for no extra cost.
#
# It emits the lock's AGE, never its raw contents. duty.sh writes an ABSOLUTE
# unix stamp (`date +%s`), and every consumer wants elapsed seconds — probe.sh
# has always converted. The first cut of this passenger shipped the stamp raw,
# so the overlay compared ~1.7e9 against STUCK_AFTER_S and a duty run that had
# started THAT SECOND rendered "STUCK — held the lock for 495881h". A false
# positive on every live tick, and the tests missed it twice over: stub-box
# answered with an already-computed age, and the real-shell test only asserted
# the field was non-empty. Both now assert it is an AGE.
#
# A non-numeric or future stamp emits nothing rather than a bogus number: a
# torn read (duty.sh writes this file at the top of every run) must never
# manufacture a wedge.
#
# `exit 0` is load-bearing and is this change's sharp edge. `.duty.lock.since`
# is ABSENT whenever no duty run is in flight, which is the normal state of a
# healthy idle box; `cat` on a missing file exits 1, so without the explicit
# exit every healthy box would fail three pings and render UNREACHABLE. The
# `[ -r ]` guard makes that impossible independently, and a test asserts a box
# with no lock file still pings ok.
#
# rc semantics are unchanged, and that is the point: a non-zero rc still means
# "could not run anything in the guest", which is the entire liveness claim.
# The parsed output is a PASSENGER — malformed, empty or absent output never
# turns into a failed ping, because the one tier that must never lie now has a
# parser attached to it. Everything it reads degrades to None.

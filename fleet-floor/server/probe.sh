# --- box vitals: the newest record, carried VERBATIM (#483 D1) --------------
#
# tick.sh writes one `VITALS …` line into duty.log per tick. This does not
# re-measure anything and does not interpret the line — it selects the newest
# one and hands it over unchanged, which is the same split every other read in
# this file observes: the box side of an exec is the half no offline test can
# reach, so anything that decides a meaning lives on the collector's side of
# it (floor.units.parse_vitals) or in `crew status`, where a test can drive it.
#
# CARRIED rather than left to the log section below, and that is the whole
# reason this line exists. `crew status` greps the box's WHOLE duty.log for
# this record; the log section here is the newest 600 lines, which is a
# transport budget, not a selection rule. A box that logged 600 lines inside
# one tick — an ordinary long session — would leave the floor with no record
# while the CLI had one, and "the two readers render the same record" would be
# true of the parse and false on screen. Same selection rule on both sides,
# stated once each.
#
# Whole-file and not `tail -n N | grep`: the window that would make this cheap
# is exactly the window that just went wrong above. duty.log is capped at 5 MB
# by tick.sh's own rotation, so the scan is bounded by construction.
#
# Empty on every box whose engine predates the probe, which is every box for
# the first tick after it lands. The collector renders that as no section.

# --- credentials: read, never tested ---------------------------------------
#
# This probe used to run `gh auth status` and the agent profile's
# bot_cli_probe on every poll. Both touch the network — `gh auth status` is a
# real api.github.com round-trip (~450ms, and the single slowest thing in this
# file; everything else is a local read) — to re-answer a question whose
# answer changes when a token expires, i.e. about monthly. At a 60s poll that
# was ~7,000 GitHub requests a day per fleet to re-learn a constant.
#
# Both are now REPORTED BY THE FLOW instead of polled. The duty engine already
# talks to GitHub every tick (duty_attention runs first, for every role), so
# it is the thing that finds out first and for free:
#
#   .auth-fail.<svc>  — written at the moment a credential is rejected or found
#                       expired, cleared on the next success.
#                       `<iso8601> <what failed>`.
#
# One boolean per service, and no expiry date: providers express expiry four
# different ways and two of the four agent CLIs cannot answer locally at all,
# so the countdown was the flaky half. What survives is the stable half, and
# it is a stronger claim than the probe it replaces — a rejection means the
# credential could not do the WORK, not merely that it authenticates against
# `GET /`, which a token with the wrong scopes does happily.
#
# The wire keys stay `gh` and `vendor`, but `ok` is gone: absence of a failure
# is not proof of a credential, and a value that cannot tell those apart is how
# a logged-out box renders green.
#
# FOUR values, because three were one short. `flowing` claims the engine has
# been talking to this service and has not been rejected — but the first cut
# derived it from `VERSION` existing, and VERSION is written once by
# install.sh and never touched again. It records that the engine was
# INSTALLED, not that it has RUN. So a box hired last month with its cron
# since disarmed and its token expired last week records no rejection (nothing
# runs to be rejected), has a VERSION, and rendered `flowing` — exactly the
# "a logged-out box renders green" failure this value exists to prevent, with
# a comment above it reassuring the reader otherwise.
#
# `flowing` therefore requires a RECENT TICK as well. But the BOX does not
# decide that: it emits `nofail` — "an engine is installed and nothing has
# recorded a rejection" — alongside `::tickage`, and the host turns the pair
# into flowing-or-stale.
#
# That split is deliberate. The threshold is two tick boundaries, which
# floor.py already derives from TICK_S as SILENT_AFTER_S. Baking `600` in here
# made a THIRD copy of that rule, in a second language, inside the box — so
# changing TICK_S would leave the floor calling a box SILENT while the
# credential readers still called it flowing. This PR exists because a CLI and
# a floor holding private sources of truth disagree in front of an operator; a
# private *threshold* is the same defect wearing a smaller hat.
#
#   unknown  no engine: nothing has ever run, so nothing is known
#   nofail   engine installed, no rejection recorded — the host ages this
#            into `flowing` (ticking), `stale` (it ticked once and stopped) or
#            `waiting` (::tickage is absent, so it has never ticked at all)
#   missing  a rejection was recorded
#
# One marker file PER SERVICE. The first cut used a single .auth-fail and
# decided which service was broken by substring-matching the reason text — so a
# gh error mentioning the word "vendor" condemned the agent CLI too, and sent
# the operator to re-login the wrong thing.

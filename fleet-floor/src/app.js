/* The signage bay — a rectangle of back wall reserved for the room's name.
   The wall text was not an object. It was two fillText calls with no extent
   and no owner, so every prop bolted to the wall since has been placed as if
   that space were empty, and three of them ended up on top of it: the
   builder's conduit ran vertically through "SECTOR-7", and dispatch parked a
   radar dish over the S and a relay panel across the rest, burying the word
   "DISPATCH" completely. Individually each prop is fine. Together they read
   as three rooms nobody composed.
   Naming the rectangle is the structural half of the fix — a prop that lands
   here is now a visible mistake against a stated rule instead of a thing that
   looked free. Making the sign an opaque bolted plate is the other half: it
   has a silhouette, it occludes what passes behind it, and it can take the

   place. So before anything new goes up, the whole wall gets stated: what is
   free, and what each free area is bounded by.
   Two constraints do most of the work. The unit stands at ROBOX=470 and is
   about 220 wide, so the centre column is not wall you can hang anything on —
   it is wall you look at the robot against, and the lamp cone runs down it.
   And each room already has floor-standing furniture backed up against the
   wall, so a bay has to stop where that starts.

/* And the rest of it, because seven rectangles out of a room is not a layout.
   Loop 11 named the sign's rectangle, loop 13 named six wall bays, and its own
   note says what was left: "every other placement still being decided by eye,
   one prop at a time" — which is the habit that put a conduit through SECTOR-7
   in the first place, still running, just further down the wall. Naming six
   free areas does not fix it while the deck, the keep-clear column and the
   fixed structure stay unstated, because a prop is placed against what is
   ALREADY THERE at least as often as against what is free.

   So: what the deck already carries, room by room, and what nothing may be
   placed on in any room. Numbers are read off the props themselves, not
   estimated — each row is the extent the function actually draws, and
   FLOORDEV.guides draws these over a rendered tile so the claim is checkable
   by looking rather than by trusting this comment.

   Declaring it found one collision immediately, which is the argument for
   declaring it: the builder's workbench ends at x=576 and its conveyor began
   at x=566, so ten pixels of belt ran through the bench top. Both are dark and
   the overlap is four pixels tall, which is exactly why eyes had not caught it
   in fifteen loops. The conveyor now starts at 580. */

     it by running that hook; do not adjust it by eye.

     The first hand-written version of this rectangle was 360..580 and wrong in
     both directions at once — narrower than codex, whose six legs splay to
     333..606, and wide enough to swallow the pegboard's left edge, so a rule
     invented to stop collisions was itself colliding with two things. Measuring
     it also settled a question nobody had asked: the inner edge of every room's
     LEFT bay is inside codex's reach (bay L starts at 250-262 and codex reaches
     333), so a prop in the inner ~40px of a left bay can be stood in front of.

/* ===================== GRID-CELL MINIATURE (god-view LOD) =====================
   The cell used to be a SECOND room. It had its own wall, its own floor, its
   own overhead lamp, its own role prop and its own signage, and it shared
   nothing with the room view but the robot sprite. That is the whole reason
   fifteen loops of art landed in the console and exactly one of them reached
   the view an operator actually scans: two functions drawing one subject drift
   the moment either is edited, and nothing ever makes them meet again. The
   ghost "SECTOR-7" the room lost in loop 11, the desk through everybody's
   shins, the role props too small to read — all of it was this.

   So the cell no longer draws a room. It renders the REAL one — the same
   drawTarget, borrowed through the same seam the asset map uses — once per
   unit into an offscreen still, blits that still every frame, and composites
   over it only what has to keep moving. The god-view is a camera pointed at
   the console now instead of a drawing of it, and the defects above are gone
   because the code that drew them is gone.

   The still is what makes it affordable. One full room costs roughly 2.5x the
   seven miniatures it replaced, so a room per cell per frame would not
   survive; miniStill owns the budget that keeps it to one render a frame. */

/* The cell's camera: which rectangle OF the room a cell is a picture of.
   The room and the cell are within 1% of the same aspect (1280x720 against
   316x180), so fitting the whole frame is possible and was the first thing
   tried — and it hands back a unit three-quarters the height it had when the
   cell drew its own, in a view whose whole job is telling four vendors apart
   at a glance. So the cell is framed rather than fitted: a rectangle wide
   enough to keep the bay, the sign and the lit props, cropped off the deep
   racks at either end, and pushed down so the floor line lands where the
   miniature always had it. The unit comes back to roughly the size it was, and

/* ===================== THE DECK STATION =====================
   THE RE-THINK. Three designed objects, five polish loops, and it still read
   as a stool at the unit's ankles. Height was the symptom; here is the error.

   The station's base sat at FLOORY=612. FLOORY is where the UNIT'S FEET are.
   So the bench was never in front of the robot — it was standing beside it, at
   the same depth, and no amount of drawer faces and scorch marks fixes an
   object that is in the wrong place in the room. A bench at the same depth as
   a person, drawn at a third of their height, is a stool. That is what it was,
   and the eye read it correctly every time.

   The room has 108 pixels of deck between FLOORY and the bottom of the frame,
   and until now nothing has ever stood on them. That is the near plane, and it
   is where a foreground object belongs: base at y=668, well in front of the
   unit's feet, and therefore BIGGER — 268 wide against the old 204, 178 tall
   against the old 46. (It went out at 156 first, and read as a coffee table:
   a worktop at this depth has to reach the unit's waist-line on screen before
   the eye accepts it as something to stand at.)

   Three things follow from moving it, and they are what make it read as depth
   rather than as a bigger stool:

     1. We see its TOP. The camera sits around the unit's chest; anything whose
        surface is below that shows the surface. A worktop 178px up at this
        depth is below it, so the top face is a trapezoid — wider at the front,
        narrower at the back — and that single piece of perspective does more
        for depth than every edge highlight in the last five loops.
     2. It is BACKLIT. The lamp is behind it and above; the floor pool is
        behind it. So the front face is the dark side, lit only by bounce and
        by the station's own fixtures, and the back arris carries a rim. A
        near-plane object is a silhouette with a lit edge, not a lit box.
     3. It OCCLUDES. It crosses the unit's legs and hides the light pool at its
        feet, which is exactly the cue the old one could never give, because
        something at the same depth cannot get in front of anything.

   The station is drawn after the fog and the steam for the same reason. */

/* ---- borrowing the room renderer -------------------------------------------
   drawTarget draws whatever the globals currently name, and writes module

   anchors the unit reported. Two callers now render rooms out of band — the
   god-view cell, every few seconds per unit, and the asset map, 36 times on
   one page — and both need the same two guarantees. A tile must not depend on
   how many frames the previous caller happened to run, or the grid stops being
   comparable and a diff stops meaning anything. And the caller's own animation
   has to be exactly where it left it afterwards, or one view's frame leaks
   into another's.

   The dev hook used to do the first and only half of the second: it reset the
   lamp and the sparks and left them reset, and never saved the footprints at
   all. That was invisible while the whiteboard was the only caller — which is
   exactly the kind of thing that stops being invisible the day a second one
   arrives. Both halves live here now, so the two callers cannot disagree about
   the contract by drifting apart. */

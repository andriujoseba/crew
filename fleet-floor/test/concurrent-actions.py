#
# #68 made the per-box work concurrent and the fixture above proves the
# concurrency — but every stub up to here DISCARDS the timeout it is handed,
# so nothing asserted the property #44 was filed about: a box that never
# answers is capped at ACTION_TIMEOUT_S, and its healthy siblings return on
# time regardless. On incus 6.0.4 the hang is the COMMON case, not the rare
# one — danmt's real-host probe measured rc=124 after the full 150s, refuting
# "a dead agent makes box exec fail fast".
#
# What is under test is that the FAN-OUT preserves the per-box cap, not that
# subprocess honours timeouts. So the stub simulates run()'s timeout contract
# — sleep to the deadline, then (124, "", "timed out after Ns") — and the real
# run() is not involved. Injecting a small ACTION_TIMEOUT_S keeps it fast:
# one() binds its default from the module global each time do_command runs, so

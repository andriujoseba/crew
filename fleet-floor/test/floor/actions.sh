# lands. A box crossing the boundary in between let an operator confirm the

# escalation through time-of-check/time-of-use rather than a duplicated
# constant, and no assertion in this suite could see it, because every case
# above posts and executes at the same instant.

# authorised — which is exactly what a stale page sends, and is the only way
# to hold the two verdicts apart in one process without sleeping through a
# poll interval and hoping.

# touched the host. `409` alone is equally true of a collector that refused
# after stopping the box, so every case asks $FLOOR_CALLS what the host was

# #487 D3/D4 — the wake went to every box incus did not call `stopped`, which

# the collector had already published as ping.wedged.
#
# MUST FAIL: the wake's own `exec` at ff-wedged in the call log. Asserted on
# argv, because a failed row for that box is what the OLD behaviour produced
# too — the difference is entirely in whether the wake was sent.
#
# THE WAKE'S OWN, not any exec at that box. $FLOOR_CALLS is shared by every
# tier: the ping tier probes the same box with `-- sh -c PING_SH` on its own
# 10s timer (floor/ping.py), and a `^exec ff-wedged ` prefix matches that
# probe exactly as well as a resume. Round 1, codex-bot: this assertion red on
# a heartbeat that happened to land inside the window, in a required suite —
# which makes whether it passes a question about background timing rather than
# about the code. So the resume is identified by its OWN argv.
#
# stub-box logs one invocation per `printf '%s\n' "$*"`, so a resume's entry is
# the argv line `exec <box> -- bash -lc ` (RESUME_SH opens with a newline, so
# nothing follows on it) with RESUME_SH's first line beneath it. Both are
# matched, because the argv line alone is shared with any other bash -lc script
# that starts with a newline.

# crew installer — puts the `crew` CLI on PATH in a VERSIONED layout under
# $DEST:
#
#   $DEST/versions/<version>/    one full tree per installed version
#   $DEST/current -> versions/<version>        the default version
#   $BINDIR/crew  -> $DEST/current/cli/crew     the PATH entry
#
# Versions install side by side: a NEW version installs beside the old one and
# becomes the default; re-running with an already-installed version is a
# converging no-op (CREW_REINSTALL=1 replaces that version's tree). `crew
# versions` / `crew use` / `crew uninstall` (heavy-duty/crew#96) manage them
# once they land; this installer lays the ground they stand on.
#
# PORTED FROM box's install.sh (heavy-duty/box#79; rig#35 is the proof the port
# works), with three crew-specific rules — each a deliberate divergence:
#
#   * PER-USER ONLY, root REFUSED. box installs globally as root because OTHER
#     users execute its tree. crew is run by ONE operator against THEIR OWN
#     boxes, and box's restricted tier makes "their own" a real boundary — a
#     root-installed crew would act on ROOT's boxes. So a root install dies
#     with that reason rather than landing in a system location.
#
#   * FLIP, then REPORT the skew — never refuse it. box refuses to move the
#     default while boxes exist (box#66), because there one version owns the
#     boxes. Here the axes are independent (heavy-duty/crew#93, finding 2): the
#     host CLI version and each box's engine version are different things, and
#     flipping the CLI touches no box. So a new version becomes the default and
#     the installer reports the boxes still to be converged, rather than
#     blocking a switch for a reason that does not apply here.
#
#   * The entrypoint is `cli/crew`, not `bin/crew` — crew's command lives in
#     cli/. The PATH link points there; cli/crew resolves its own real path
#     (readlink -f) so $CREW_ROOT lands in the versioned tree, not $BINDIR.
#
# THE INSTALL SOURCE IS A LOCAL TREE (heavy-duty/crew#98) — CREW_INSTALL_SOURCE, defaulting
# to the tree this script lives in — so a checkout installs itself, CI installs
# the code under review, and heavy-duty/crew#98's self-contained scp-able
# artifact installs by unpacking and pointing CREW_INSTALL_SOURCE at the
# result. Network distribution is #98's job, not this file's.

# Non-root installs per-user; root is refused outright (see the header). box's
# global-install branch is deliberately dropped.

# --- the payload -----------------------------------------------------------
# THE INSTALLED TREE IS THE PRODUCT, NOT THE REPOSITORY (heavy-duty/crew#365).
# One rule decides every line below: a path ships only if something an
# installed tree RUNS reads it — `cli/crew`, the `shared/` engine it pushes to
# boxes, or `fleet-floor/server/` serving the console. Everything else is
# repository furniture: it is read in a checkout, by CI, by the release
# ceremony or by a contributor, and on a host it is bytes every `crew upgrade`
# moves for nothing.
#
# What that leaves, so the next person adding a directory can tell which side
# it falls on: `cli/`, `shared/` (bar its suite), `examples/` (cli/crew's
# config fallback), `VERSION`, `install.sh`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and
# `fleet-floor/`'s pre-built `index.html` plus `server/`.
#
# ONE list, TWO enforcements. The paths are named once, each with its reason;
# what follows derives both the `tar --exclude` array and prune_payload(). The
# script acquires its tree two ways — a DIRECTORY (a checkout, the scp-able
# artifact's unpacked temp dir, `dist/curl-install.sh`'s extracted tree) or a
# TARBALL (`dist/fetch.sh` hands over the file `gh` streamed, and the README's
# own `CREW_INSTALL_SOURCE=<a crew tree or tarball>` form) — and the rule has
# to be a property of the TREE, not of the branch that got it: filtering only
# the tar left the tarball branch installing 52M while this comment claimed
# otherwise (claude-bot and codex-bot, round 1 on #365). So the prune runs on
# whatever was acquired, and a third acquisition shape inherits the rule by
# construction; the tar excludes stay as what they are — the optimisation that
# keeps the directory branch from copying 30M in order to delete it.

#
#   1. The root is required and must be a real directory. An empty $1 would
#      make every removal a bare relative path in $PWD.
#   2. Nothing is removed THROUGH a symlink. `rm -rf -- "$root/shared/test"`
#      resolves `shared` during pathname resolution — only the last component
#      of the path is safe from being followed — so a source whose `shared` is
#      a symlink had this delete a directory outside the tree entirely while
#      the install still exited 0 (codex-bot, round 2 on #365). The escape
#      arrived with the prune; the directory branch never had it, because tar

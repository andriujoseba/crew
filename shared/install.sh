# A file the tree does not ship must not survive an install (see the sweep
# below), and neither must a DIRECTORY the tree does not ship. Nothing crew
# installs makes bin/ or conf/ a symlink, so one that is a link is an operator's
# redirect: the engine executes out of a directory this version never shipped,
# and the record written at the end would certify it as `current`. That is the
# sweep's laundering hole one component up — detection already names the
# redirect (`added bin`), and detecting it and then blessing it is worse than
# never having looked.
#
# Every directory COMPONENT of the engine surface, parents first. `conf` is in
# the list without being an engine-manifest root of its own: it carries conf/roles,
# conf/agents and conf/fleet.defaults.conf, so a redirect there moves the whole
# role and agent set off the shipped tree. Parents first matters — normalizing
# `conf` materializes conf/roles behind it, and the child pass then sees whatever
# that restored, link or not.
#
# $DUTY_DIR itself is NOT in the list: `~/duty` pointed at another volume is a
# location the operator chose, not content crew shipped.
#
# This runs BEFORE anything is written. That ordering is the whole trick: the
# sweep at the end deliberately cannot touch a root, because by then the install
# has written the fresh engine THROUGH the redirect and moving the link would
# carry the engine off with it. Here nothing has been written yet, so the root
# can be replaced outright.
#
# The contents are copied out THROUGH the link, never through its resolved
# target, so a relative target needs no resolution and a dangling one is simply
# an empty restore. Then the link itself is parked in legacy/ — as a link, so
# its target string survives as the evidence, outside the engine surface — and
# the restored contents take its place as a real directory. The install writes
# into that, and the ordinary sweep parks whatever this version does not ship,
# naming each file. So a redirected root converges by exactly the path and the
# messages an ordinary one does, with no second mechanism to keep in step.

# --- The installed engine IS the shipped engine (#159) -----------------------
# Copying over matching names converges every file the incoming tree HAS. It
# says nothing about a file the incoming tree does NOT have: an operator's
# ~/duty/bin/hotfix.sh, or a lib/ module three versions dead. Left where it is,
# that file survives the install and is then hashed into the new record — the
# box reads `current` with unshipped executable code in it, and --force stops
# being an escape hatch and becomes a laundering step. An instrument that
# certifies exactly what it was built to catch is worse than no instrument.
#
# So the engine roots converge in both directions. What this install did not
# put here MOVES — it does not vanish. Preserving the bytes is the argument of
# #159 itself: the hotfix nobody told the fleet about is evidence, and legacy/
# is already where this installer parks files it must not leave in place. It
# sits outside the engine-manifest roots, so the record at the end describes
# shipped content and nothing else.
#
# conf/agents is swept like the rest, though operator profiles are transported
# rather than shipped. A direct-checkout install stages no seed dir and so
# parks them, which costs this box nothing: the resolution above refuses to
# install at all unless THIS box's agent profile resolves, no code on a box
# ever reads another agent's profile, and the next host-driven install
# transports the whole set back.
#
# These roots are engine-manifest.sh's MANIFEST_ROOTS. conf/fleet.defaults.conf
# is its only other entry and is put on every install, so it needs no sweep;
# conf/instance.conf, conf/fleet.conf, the registries, work/, trees/ and logs/
# are outside the engine surface by the same reasoning documented there.
#
# The sweep enumerates every non-directory entry, not `-type f`: `find` walks
# straight past a symlink, so before this `ln -s /anything ~/duty/bin/hotfix.sh`
# survived --force and was then certified `current` — the regular-file hole this
# sweep exists to close, one character away. `mv` moves a link as itself, so the
# bytes-preserving park needs nothing else.
#
# The root entry itself is not swept here, and does not need to be:
# normalize_redirects (above) already ran, before anything was written, and a
# redirected root is by now a real directory holding what was behind the link.
# Sweeping a root HERE is what cannot work — the install has written the fresh
# engine through it, so moving the link would carry the engine off with it. The
# trailing slash stays for the case this cannot see: a redirect normalization
# warned about and could not clear. Then the record is withheld anyway, and
# descending is still the honest read of what is installed.

# copy of the rule here: a private second implementation of "which login is
# this box" is how the panel copy (#285) and the git copy (#294) both happened.
#
# This can only run when the box is ALREADY authenticated — which is the
# upgrade and re-hire path, and therefore the automatic sweep of a live fleet.
# A first hire is authenticated BY HAND afterwards, so there is no truth to
# copy yet; the engine converges on the first tick after that login, before any
# session. Said out loud below rather than left as a silent no-op, because
# "provisioning writes it" is only half true and the operator owns the half
# that is not.

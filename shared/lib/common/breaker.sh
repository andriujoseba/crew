# common/breaker.sh — the per-lane dispatch breakers and what feeds them.
#
# TWO reasons stop a lane, and they answer different questions:
#   - TERMINAL (_session_terminal_*, session_terminal) — the lane cannot
#     succeed. Consecutive terminal failures, cleared by whatever falsifies
#     the cause: a vendor probe where the vendor is what died, an observed
#     session end where it was not (#551).
#   - BUDGET (_session_budget_*) — the lane has spent enough. Volume in a
#     rolling window, cleared by the window rolling (#464).
# They share the skip, the log-line shape, the per-kind state file convention
# and the alert channel, which is D3 of #464: the budget invents no second
# mechanism, it supplies a second reason to pull the one that exists.
#
# Both live here rather than in common/session.sh because deciding that a lane
# is closed is not dispatching — the same split that put the terminal
# classifier here. Neither is a new module, so #507's one-suite-per-module
# mirror is unchanged: shared/test/common/breaker.sh covers both.
#
# A module of shared/lib/common.sh, which is the entry point: nothing sources
# this file directly.
#
# shellcheck shell=bash
# shellcheck disable=SC2034  # RUN_SESSION_RC/RUN_SESSION_LOG are run_session's
# out-of-band result, read by the caller (duty-triage.sh's ledger commits)

# _session_terminal_state KIND — one state file per dispatch lane. Keeping the
# kind in the filename is what lets a dead review credential stop review work
# without silencing an unrelated attention, build, or triage lane.

# THE TRIP HAS TWO CLEARS, because it has two causes (#551).
#
# #388 built this breaker for a dead vendor, and a successful `bot_cli_probe`
# is the right clear for that: the probe falsifies the failure being counted.
# This window lands terminals the vendor did not cause — #478's reconstructed
# terminal, written when a session dies with its box — and they inherited that
# clear, so the probe cleared a trip it had falsified nothing about. A lane
# whose box kills every session therefore ran the cycle trip → probe → clear →
# dispatch → die, forever: three dispatches per four ticks and an alert pair
# per cycle, which is a throttle and not a stop.
#
# So the state carries WHICH KIND OF TERMINAL contributed, and each cause keeps
# the clear that falsifies it:
#
#   vendor-caused    → `bot_cli_probe` succeeds, exactly as it does today.
#   non-vendor       → an OBSERVED session end on the lane: a session that
#                      started, ran and wrote its own SESSION END. Finishing is
#                      the proof the box survived it, which is the thing a
#                      probe cannot say. Held lanes are retried on a widening
#                      bounded interval so that evidence can arrive at all.
#
# One breaker and not two (D4, and #464's D3 before it): the skip line, the
# state-file convention, the log-line shape and the alert channel are the ones
# that already exist. Only the clear condition differs, which is the whole of
# what this adds.

# The state file is ONE tab-separated line, and it GREW rather than changed
# shape:

#
# _session_terminal_read STATE — read it into `_TERMINAL_*`, returning 1 when
# there is no state to read. Every field this added degrades to the value that
# reproduces the pre-#551 behaviour exactly: no non-vendor contribution, no
# trial spent, no wait outstanding. That is what lets an engine upgrade land
# under a lane that is already tripped without resetting it, and it is the same
# obligation the conf keys carry — degrade, never abort the tick under `set -u`.

# else (D2), so no lib/duty-*.sh learns the word "budget".
#
# Counted in BOTH sessions and session-minutes, per kind, per rolling window
# (D1): 2399 mentions at 1.57 minutes and a handful of hour-long builds are

# The window default. It is here and not only in the conf for the reason the

# CONFIGURED means the conf says so, and nothing else. An earlier cut of this
# read the ceilings out of the state file, which the gate writes, and so
# answered "which lanes have dispatched since being armed" instead: a lane
# armed an hour ago printed nothing until its first dispatch, a raised ceiling
# printed the superseded number, and — worst — a lane whose ceilings had been
# REMOVED kept printing a bound nobody was enforcing. The conf is where the
# gate reads its ceilings, so it is where the report reads them, and the two
# cannot now disagree about what is armed or what the bound is.
#
# The state file keeps exactly the half it owns: the spend. It is read through
# _session_budget_load, the gate's own reader, so "unreadable" means here
# precisely what it means there — including the window it prunes by, which
# comes from the conf too.
#
# The ROW is rendered on the BOX and `crew status` prints it verbatim, the same
# thing it already does with the duty.log tail. The conf that decides all of
# this lives on the box; a renderer on the operator's host would have to
# resolve a role conf it does not have, and no offline suite could reach it,
# while shared/test/common/breaker.sh drives this one beside the gate whose
# balance it prints.
#
# Prints NOTHING when no lane is configured, which is what lets `crew status`
# omit the section entirely rather than print an empty heading — and a lane
# that is off prints nothing even when a stale counter for it survives, because
# a row for an unenforced ceiling is the one statement this view must not make.

# outcomes and vendor spend: this is the balance the gate is already keeping,

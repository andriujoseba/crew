# run_session KIND KEY DIR TIMEOUT PROMPT — the only way a duty launches the
# box CLI. Adds what every hand-rolled variant lacked somewhere: a timeout (a
# hung session used to hold the flock forever, invisibly), captured exit
# status on every path, a per-session log file, and one structured outcome
# line in duty.log (the biggest logging gap in three of five metrics files).

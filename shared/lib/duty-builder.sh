# duty-builder.sh — builder wakes, in doctrine priority order (FLEET.md):
# resume → ci-red → build (ready issues / completed rounds) → handoff →
# rebase, plus worktree hygiene. ci-red precedes build because your own red
# head outranks a new claim (ceremony BUILDER.md); the block order in this
# file IS the tick order, and this header is what FLEET.md is reconciled
# against. All review predicates use latestOpinionatedReviews, NEVER
# latestReviews or reviewDecision: COMMENTED can mask a standing opinion in
# latestReviews, while reviewDecision exists only
# under branch protection and stays "" here — keying on it silently stalled
# rounds for a day (ceremony#26, #39).

# only at ceremony — but an org-wide author sweep also lets a builder box
# act on repos nobody put in its registry, which is the same unbounded write

# _request_panel REPO NUM PAYLOAD PANEL_JSON CHECK_STATE HC_HEAD — engine-side
# panel (re-)request, and state:bots-reviewing beside it (#133). This moves the
# request off the builder SESSION, where a session that died between its last
# push and its re-request left a PR that looked finished and was waiting for
# nobody — the blocker:unrequested shape.
#
# THE ENGINE ACTS ONLY ON THE SESSION'S SIGNAL, never on commit activity — the
# issue's hardest must-fail. The signal is a MARK_ANSWERED comment the session
# posts once it has answered the round whole (reply + any fix pushed) and after
# it first marks a PR ready-for-review. This function requests only when a
# MARK_ANSWERED for the CURRENT head is present: a mid-fix WIP push (green head,
# no answer yet) carries no such marker, so the panel is never re-requested
# under an unfinished round. A session that dies before posting the marker does
# not strand the PR — resume.txt re-posts it, so a missing marker only delays to
# the next tick, it never stalls forever (the old permanent-stall bug).
#

  # A RED HEAD IS NOT A ROUND (#45). The rule is the author's: a review request
  # requires a green check at the head, because a red check is the author's own
  # signal and not the panel's work. Measured on crew#40 — two consecutive
  # heads, four reviewer-rounds, every one relaying a CI failure already visible
  # in the job log. The most expensive of the four opened with "CI is red at
  # this head … that gates my approval" and stopped looking, so the cost is not
  # the wasted round, it is the findings that round did not make.
  #
  # Enforced here rather than left to the prompt. The doctrine belongs in
  # fragment-round-rules.txt as well, and is there — but a rule only a model can
  # apply is a rule that gets dropped under a long context, and this one has to
  # hold for every round of every builder. Nothing is stranded by the exclusion:
  # a red head has already woken the ci-red block above, which is the work that
  # has to happen first regardless.
  #
  # ADMIT `green` OR `none`; HOLD `red` AND `pending` (danmt's ruling, #64).
  #
  # The gate is a whitelist for the same reason `is_green` is: "everything but
  # red" is a fallthrough, and a fallthrough is what the CANCELLED bug was.
  # The three states are three different facts and get three behaviours.
  #
  #   red      HELD, and it is the author's own work. Wakes ci-red above.
  #   pending  HELD, and it is NOT the author's work — it is a check that has
  #            not answered yet. Opening the round now spends the panel on a
  #            head that may go red, which is exactly what #45 measured on
  #            crew#40. Transient by definition: the item re-evaluates next
  #            tick (5 minutes) and admits itself once the check settles
  #            green. Must NOT wake ci-red — nothing has failed.
  #   none     ADMITTED. Terminal, not transient: a repo with no CI configured
  #            is `none` FOREVER, so holding on it means the engine can never
  #            open a review round in that repo at all. head-checks.jq already
  #            rules this a state of its own rather than a not-green one — "a
  #            repo with no CI configured and a repo whose checks all passed
  #            are different facts, and only one of them is evidence."
  #
  # Two holds, two messages. A pending hold that borrowed the red wording
  # ("CI first") would tell the operator the author owes work when the author
  # owes nothing but a wait, and that misreading is the whole distinction the
  # ruling draws.
  #
  # An admitted `none` head still travels into the build prompt: the session is
  # bound by the same green-at-the-head rule, and `none` is the one state where
  # there is no check coming to wait for. Telling it so beats it inferring so.

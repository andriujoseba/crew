# --- The decline: a ready issue the session judged unbuildable ---------------
#
# The BUILD block below has told whoever reads this source, since #59, that a
# ready issue clears its signal only on a claim "which is an action the session
# may correctly decline (out of scope, unbuildable, needs a ruling)". Nothing
# carried that to the session — it is handed build.txt, which said claim it and
# build it — and nothing carried the decision back: _ready_lines_to_commit
# reduces the whole discovery to an id and a timestamp in a per-box dotfile that
# dies with the box. So the board, the only memory that outlives a box, learned
# nothing; every sibling box re-derived the same refusal from scratch, and
# triage, which OWES the repair (TRIAGE.md's claim-time clause, ceremony#487),
# never got the input. What stopped the claim in practice was a hand-written
# paragraph in the consumer repo's issue body, absent by default, and where it
# was absent it did not hold — box#180 was claimed against `df`-on-a-host
# criteria and caught only afterwards (#462).
#
# FOUR reasons, not the three that comment names. #461 removes `operator-owned`
# as a cause by keeping such an issue off `ready` at all; until it ships the
# session still meets one, and the other three are spec defects no label
# prevents. The set is CLOSED and revalidated on read-back: an unrecognised
# token is not a reason and is never reported as one, because the line an
# operator reads must not be writable by a session's free text.

#   precedent while still keying on something narrower than a whole body.

# _no_build_duty_reason BOARD_READY LEDGERED_ROUNDS SLOT_PRS BOARD_READ DECLINED
# — the parenthetical on `no build duty`.
#
# One spelling for three causes is a diagnosis tax on every reader. On
# 2026-08-03 the operator read `build duty (ready unclaimed=8)` → claim → `no
# build duty` ten minutes later, which is indistinguishable from the burial bug
# #264 exists to prevent; an hour of ledger reads later the answer was that the
# slot was held. The prefix stays `$R: no build duty` so `crew status` and every
# grep consumer are untouched — only the parenthetical is new (#345).
#
# The order is causal, not cosmetic — first match wins, and the first match is
# the most useful answer, not the only true one:
#   slot        the gate zeroed a ready count that was still non-zero AFTER the
#               ledger ran, so the ready side is the slot's doing. The rounds
#               side can be ledger-held on the same tick — an open PR whose
#               owed round is already seen at that head — and this branch then
#               prints the slot clause alone: incomplete, never false, and the
#               slot is the answer an operator is actually looking for.
#   seen-ledger nothing is left for the slot to explain, and the ledger hid all
#               of what was enumerated. In this branch the counts are
#               whole-set: a partial suppression leaves ready_count/cr_count
#               non-zero and never reaches here.
#   board empty what is left when nothing was enumerated at all.
# `board unread` is the fourth state and not a fourth cause: the issue listing
# failed, so which of the two above holds is unknown and neither may be
# asserted. The warn at that call site names the failure; this says only that
# the board behind the line was never read.
#
# `declined` is not a fifth cause either — it is the ledger branch finally able
# to name what it is holding. `N ready held by seen-ledger` was honest and it
# was the wrong noun: it named the MECHANISM and never the cause, so an operator
# could not tell a spec defect from a box that ran out of context, and could not
# tell that the refusal would be identical on every box forever. Where the
# record has a reason for some of the held ready lines, the two halves are
# reported separately: a decline is triage's to repair, a plain ledger hold is
# not, and one number covering both is a number nobody can act on (#462). It
# ranks under the slot for the reason the slot outranks the ledger — the slot is
# the answer to "why did the claim not happen" whenever it fired.

# wrong is that the engine said so on EVERY pass, forever, about a condition
# nothing in the loop can change: the same two lines every five minutes for
# days on build/77-fleet-action-status (PR #103, merged). A warning that
# repeats forever is not a warning, it is wallpaper, and this fleet already
# has a family of defects that survived because a signal was present and
# unread (#114, #147, #155, #158). So the ledger buys silence for a condition
# already stated once — not for an unstated one (#59).
#
# THE DIRT GOES IN THE ID, AND THE VALUE IS A FIXED SENTINEL — the ci-red
# scheme (#17) for the same reason: ledger_filter re-fires when the VALUE
# sorts greater, and a dirt fingerprint has no order. Keyed the ordinary way,
# a worktree that became dirty in a NEW way whose fingerprint happened to sort
# below the old one would be suppressed — losing the report exactly when the
# condition changed, which is the one thing this ledger must not do.
#

# Ignored dirt no longer blocks a removal, so every refusal that remains is
# real uncommitted work: modified tracked files, or untracked files nobody
# chose to ignore. A merged PR proves the COMMITTED content reached main and
# says nothing about that. `bin/claim-issue.sh` and its 20-assertion suite once
# existed only as untracked files on claude-builder; a sweep that forced on
# "the PR merged" would have taken them silently, every five minutes, on five
# boxes, unattended.
#
# So the work is pushed to a remote first and the force is the CONSEQUENCE of
# that push landing — never a flag anyone can reach for. A remote, not a local
# stash or a copy under ~/duty: both die at the next `crew upgrade` (#159), and
# a preservation that does not survive the thing it is preserving against is
# not preservation.

# _wt_preserve_remote PATH — where a preservation push goes. `fork` when the
# clone has one, else `origin`.
#
# #168 first said "push it to origin", and on a one-remote clone that is what
# this returns. On a fleet clone it is not: ensure_main_clone adds `fork` at
# the bot's own fork precisely because the bot cannot write to the upstream —
# builds push there, and a preservation that pushed to origin would be refused
# on every box, leaving the force unearned and every dirty worktree stuck
# forever. Triage amended the criterion to the writable remote on 2026-08-05,
# for that reason: `origin` was unsatisfiable in production rather than merely
# inconvenient, and the requirement's own reason — it must outlive the box and
# the next `crew upgrade` — turns on *remote*, not on *origin*. Naming the

# _wt_record REPO PR BRANCH PATH REMOTE REF SHA URL [STAGED] — the durable half
# of a preservation: a comment on the PR the worktree belonged to, naming the
# remote, the ref, what it holds and the staged snapshot where there is one.
# Returns 0 only once that comment is present.
#
# The payload and the record fail differently, which is the whole reason they
# are separate (triage, #168, 2026-08-05). A `wip/` ref lives on the bot's fork
# because that is the only remote it can write to, and a fork is not durable in
# this org: the public-repo flip detached the bots' forks once already, and an
# org-level action nobody associates with worktrees can take the payload with
# it. A comment upstream survives fork deletion, box destruction and identity
# rotation, and for the 99% of preservations that are worthless it is enough to
# decide so without fetching anything.
#
# post-once.sh, not a bare POST and not a local ledger: its dedup is an exact
# body match against the comments endpoint, so a tick that dies between the push
# and the removal re-records nothing, and a ledger that dies with the box cannot
# make the same promise. The body is deterministic in the sha and the counts —
# same dirt, same body, no second comment; changed dirt, new sha, a new record,
# which is right, because it holds something else.
#
# THE COUNTS COME FROM THE WORKTREE, not from the ref they describe
# (@claude-bot-andresmgsl, #376, argued and not taken). Deriving them with
# `diff-tree HEAD..<tip>` would tie them to the payload by construction, which
# was the right instinct while the ref was one commit — but the ref is a chain
# now, and its tip legitimately equals HEAD's tree for a worktree whose work is
# all staged and reverted. That record would read "0 modified, 0 untracked" over
# real preserved content: the "reads like a triviality" failure this record was
# hardened against, reintroduced by the fix for it. Walking the chain instead
# means teaching the record to reconstruct dirt the worktree states in one read.
# So the read stays, and the cross-check does the work the derivation would:
# p168-record-counts-nested-untracked asserts the counts against the ref's own
# file list, so a systematic drift between them fails the suite.

# _resume_attach_comments REPO LISTING — the answer is the same listing with
# `.comments` filled for every non-draft PR, and it comes back in a GLOBAL,
# RESUME_LISTING, for the reason _resume_gate states
# below: every report here is a log line, log writes to stdout, and a function
# that returned its data through the same channel would fold its own warnings
# into the JSON the caller parses.
#
# THE LISTING STOPPED CARRYING COMMENTS AND NOTHING SAID SO. `_stranded_resume_keys`
# classifies a PR by reading `.comments` off this listing, and the field left it
# at 70823ac (#314) — correctly for the foreign-activity half that commit was
# about, and silently for the signal half, because `.comments // []` reads an
# absent field as an empty thread. Every non-draft authored PR has therefore
# classified as unsignalled since, and a near-miss predicate would have had
# nothing to run against. The comments come back here rather than in the listing
# so the foreign half keeps the paginated read #314 gave it.
#
# A PR whose thread could not be read gets `.comments = null`, NOT an empty
# array: the predicates below skip a null and the PR leaves the stranded set for
# this tick, forfeiting its counter. That is the safe direction. Read as an empty
# thread it would look unsignalled — accruing toward a resume the evidence does
# not support — and a transient failure costing one restarted count is cheaper
# than a resume session spent on a PR that signalled correctly.
#
# DRAFTS ARE READ TOO, since #384. The two predicates that filter drafts out do
# so themselves, so nothing above changes; what needs the draft's thread is
# _flip_owed_resume_rows, whose whole question is whether a DRAFT carries a
# valid signal at its head. The cost is one paginated REST read per draft per
# tick, beside the two _resume_newest_foreign already makes for the same draft.
# THE THREAD DOES NOT TRAVEL ON ARGV (#479). `--argjson comments "$comments"`
# made the whole thread ONE argv element, and a single element is bounded by
# MAX_ARG_STRLEN — 32 pages, 131,072 bytes — not by the ARG_MAX everyone quotes.
# Past that, `execve` fails with E2BIG, `|| spliced=""` swallowed it, the listing
# went through unchanged, and the PR reached the predicates with `.comments`
# ABSENT, which they read as null and skip. A thread never shrinks, so the
# condition never cleared: the guarantee this file states above — "a missing
# marker only delays to the next tick, it never stalls forever" — was void above
# the limit, and every downstream safety net (_green_head_breaker, the #384
# green-head bypass, _stranded_resume_due's counter) sits BELOW the splice, so
# nothing reasoning about the stranded set could reach the PR at all. It read as
# `no resume duty` — a clean board — for 86 minutes.
#
# `--slurpfile` from a process substitution is the fix: argv carries `/dev/fd/N`
# and the payload travels down a pipe, so the bound that applies is the one that
# scales. A temp file would do the same, and is not used, because allocating one
# introduces a failure mode of its own — a full `TMPDIR` — on the exact path
# whose job is to classify failures; the substitution has nothing to allocate.
#
# TRANSIENT AND STRUCTURAL ARE NOT THE SAME SKIP, and the discriminator is which
# half failed. The READ is a network call, so `gh` returning nonzero is the
# transient class the original swallow was written for: it skips the PR for the
# tick, forfeits its counter, and is retried unchanged next tick. The SPLICE is a
# local deterministic fold of two values already in hand — no network, no API, no
# rate limit — so a splice that fails will fail identically next tick on inputs
# that only ever grow. That will not clear on its own, and a permanent condition
# is not a per-tick skip: it escalates to the operator through `alert`, naming
# the PR, the head and the issue a human should flag, rather than waiting for
# someone to notice a board that looks clean — and posts that same fact on the PR
# through post-once.sh, because an alert nothing acknowledges can be dropped
# without trace and this escalation fires only once per head. Why that channel
# and not a label write, and why the record is a separate object from the wake,
# is _resume_structural_escalate's own header, below.
#
# EVERY BRANCH WARNS, including the one that cannot even mark the thread unread.
# A swallow with no warn is what turned a stall into a clean board, so the
# absence of a log line is the defect being fixed here and not an omission.

# _resume_structural_escalate REPO NUM LISTING — put a structural splice failure
# in front of the operator, once per head.
#
# THE CHANNEL IS `alert`, NOT THE `attention` LABEL, and #479's D3 says so since
# triage ruled it on 2026-08-26. The label is hand-set doctrine — LABELS.md:99
# and 185-187 ("the machine never sets `attention`"), shared/prompts/attention.txt
# from the other end ("never set it yourself"), and the enforcement in
# engine-never-writes-attention-label (shared/test/builder.sh, since 9fb7e3d):
# "`attention` remains a hand-written demand. Reads in duty-attention.sh are the
# wake mechanism and are allowed; engine label writes are not". `alert` is the
# channel the engine already owns for exactly this class: duty_attention_audit
# uses it to report a board invariant it observes and does not fix, and crew#66's
# implemented close is the precedent for the shape — a module that observes a
# condition it may not act on pings the operator rather than only logging, which
# is what made its bound affordable. (#66 ruled repos.txt scope, NOT who writes
# the label; the doctrine above is what forecloses the label write. Triage's
# correction, 2026-08-26, recorded here because this header was quoted for it.)
# The escalation therefore NAMES the issue a human should flag rather than
# flagging it, and D3's purpose — a permanent condition is never a per-tick skip,
# and never waits to be noticed — is met without the engine taking the write.
#
# THE ALERT CARRIES A RECEIPT, and the receipt is not decoration (@danmt, via
# #479, 2026-08-26). `alert` is fire-and-forget: with no token file it is a
# silent no-op RETURNING SUCCESS, with one it is a ten-second best-effort with no
# retry whose failure is explicitly non-fatal (common.sh). Every other alert in
# the tree survives that because the condition it names re-fires next tick. THIS
# ONE DOES NOT — the once-per-head ledger below is exactly what makes a single
# dropped message a permanently lost escalation, which is this issue's own
# board-looks-clean failure moved one layer out. So the alert is the wake and the
# post-once.sh comment is the record, the pairing duty-attention.sh:246-248
# already ships in this subsystem. The body carries the full head, so post-once's
# exact-body dedup is once-per-head for free and no second suppression scheme is
# owed; it carries the same `where` clause as the alert, so the branch where the
# body names no authorizing issue gets its receipt by construction and not by a
# second code path. A receipt that does not post warns, like every other failure
# on this path: the alert is then the only copy and that is worth saying.
#
# The authorizing issue comes from the body through _RESUME_ISSUE_RE, the one
# pattern _resume_pr_fingerprints reads, so the two can never disagree about
# which issue a PR answers. A body naming none still escalates — the PR number is
# enough to act on, and a missing reference is itself worth saying.
#
# ONCE PER HEAD, on the ci-red scheme (#17): the head goes in the ledger's ID and
# never in its value, because ledger_filter re-fires when the value sorts greater
# and a SHA has no order. A new head is an id never seen, so a corrective push
# re-escalates — right, the condition being re-asserted against a tree that
# changed — while an unchanged head does not alert the operator every five
# minutes. #167's rule: a warning that repeats forever is wallpaper. The
# suppressed report is what keeps that quiet from becoming a silence, and it runs
# only on the ticks that did NOT alert — reporting a suppression on the very tick
# the alert fired would say "still standing" about its own first occurrence.

# conclusion is neither. PR #381 pushed d4b8035, held its signal for `ci-floor`,
# and was still parked forty-six minutes after that check went green — there was
# no wake to be had. The two helpers below are the missing read, and they answer
# two different questions off the ONE listing the resume block already fetches:
# WHEN the head last concluded (the fingerprint's new term) and WHAT it
# concluded (the two due-predicates' evidence).

# _resume_check_states REPO LISTING — one `<num>\t<green|red|pending|none>` row
# per PR in LISTING, DRAFTS INCLUDED. Nonzero means the rollup could not be
# graded and every caller must drop that half for the tick.
#
# It grades through head-checks.jq rather than restating the rule, which is what
# _ci_red_rollup_settled already does for the same reason: `is_green` is a
# whitelist whose fail-closed direction was bought with #64, and a second copy
# of it in this file would be a second predicate. The shaping is the price —
# head-checks.jq filters drafts out and joins the round-owed fact, so `isDraft`
# is forced false and an empty `$panel` makes `round_owed`'s panel clause
# uniformly false — with an empty `$human` doing the same to its human clause
# (#452). Only field 4 is read here; the round-owed column stays the request

# A StatusContext carries no completedAt at all, so its start stands in — but

# against every real rollup — met for a repo whose checks are CheckRuns, crew's

# _near_miss_resume_rows REPO ME MARK LISTING — LISTING is the same listing

#
# THE BYPASS IS ABOUT EVIDENCE, NOT IMPATIENCE. `_stranded_resume_due`'s twelve

# sight — the session announced a head it had finished, and only the wire format

# silence still buys the full twelve, which is the case that threshold was
# measured against.
#
# DETECTED, NEVER HONOURED. Nothing here requests a panel, sets a label, or
# writes to the board at all — the near-miss buys exactly one thing, a resume
# session that posts the real signal. Honouring it would make unrendered
# template text into wire protocol, and #133's rule that the engine acts only on
# the session's own signal is worth more than the fourteen minutes it saves.
#

# or deleted here or in the prompt: it is the only trace this class of failure
# leaves, and the WARN names its id so a reader can find it rather than so

# in the global GREEN_HEAD_ROWS, one `<num>\t<head>` line per non-draft PR of
# mine whose head is GREEN and carries no valid signal, with one WARN per
# detection. A global for the same reason the near-miss rows are one.
#
# THE HEAD RIDES BESIDE THE NUMBER because the caller needs it to build the
# `<repo>#<num>@<head>` key `_resume_breaker` counts by (_green_head_breaker).
# Deriving it there from a second read of the listing would be a second chance
# for the two to describe different heads, which is _near_miss_resume_rows's
# reason for carrying its comment id in the row rather than re-reading it.
#
# DETECTION IS NOT DISPATCH, and this function only detects. The WARN below
# therefore names the evidence and stops: whether this tick actually resumes is
# the breaker's answer, said at the breaker's own site. An earlier cut of this
# function ended its WARN with "so resuming this tick instead of the twelfth" —
# a promise it does not get to make once a bypass can be suppressed.
#
# THE BYPASS IS ABOUT EVIDENCE, NOT IMPATIENCE — the same argument #319 made,
# reaching the same conclusion from the other datum. `_stranded_resume_due`'s
# twelve ticks are the price of not knowing whether a session died before it
# signalled or is still working. A green head with no signal answers that
# question on sight: the checks have finished, the head is passing, and nothing
# a session could still be waiting for is outstanding. There is nothing left to
# wait for, so the PR is due now.
#
# PENDING AND RED STILL BUY THE FULL TWELVE, and that is the case the threshold
# was measured against. A pending head has not answered the question the panel
# will ask; a red one is the author's own next task and wakes ci-red instead.
# `none` is deliberately not green here either, though the request gate admits
# it: `none` is also what a head reads a few seconds after a push, before its
# workflows register, so a bypass on `none` would fire one tick after every push
# in a repo with CI. Waiting the twelve there is the status quo, not a
# regression, and it is the fail-safe direction.
#
# DETECTED, NEVER HONOURED. Nothing here requests a panel, sets a label, or

# _flip_owed_resume_rows REPO ME MARK PANEL LISTING — the third stuck state, and
# the one neither engine path can leave. The answer comes back in the global
# FLIP_OWED_ROWS, one `<num>` line per DRAFT of mine that carries a valid signal
# at its CURRENT head, whose head is GREEN, and for which no panelist is
# requested — with one WARN per detection. RESUME_FORCE_FRESH carries the same
# PRs as `<repo>#<num>@<head>` ledger keys, which is how _resume_gate hears
# about them.
#
# THE HOLE IS BETWEEN TWO CORRECT PATHS. PR #386 was ready, green, and carried a
# valid current-head signal; the request pass was six seconds from running when
# the PR was converted to draft. The handoff listing filters drafts out
# (`select(.isDraft | not)`), so the request path stopped seeing it; the resume
# ledger suppressed it, the head being unchanged and no foreign actor having
# spoken. Both are individually right and together nothing in the engine could
# leave that state — no panel was ever requested.
#
# A DUE-PREDICATE, NOT A FLIP. BUILDER.md rules that "an engine may draft a PR
# but only the builder undrafts it": the flip asserts the round was answered
# whole, which is the one judgement its author cannot delegate. So this buys
# exactly what the other two predicates buy, one resume session, and the session
# decides. Nothing here flips, requests, or labels.
#
# WHY THE OPERATOR'S DRAFT IS NOT THE DEFECT. Converting to draft is the fleet's
# general unstick lever, and it is right for one failure mode and wrong for the
# other: it re-armed #381's fingerprint and woke that builder in five minutes,
# and it consumed #386's completed handoff. Nobody can tell those apart from
# outside. With this predicate the lever is safe in both, which is the reason to
# have it rather than a footnote to it.
#
# A DRAFT WITH NO VALID SIGNAL IS UNTOUCHED — that is ordinary interrupted work,
# and it keeps the ledger-and-breaker path it already has.
#
# "NO PANEL REQUESTED" IS REQUEST-PANEL.JQ'S ANSWER, NEVER A SECOND COPY OF IT,
# and the difference is not academic. The obvious reading — nobody is on
# `reviewRequests` — is true of a completely different PR: one the engine itself
# redrafted because a round closed against its author (_redraft_authored_pr),
# where the panel HAS answered, its requests are consumed, and a stale
# current-head signal can still be sitting on the thread. That draft owes a
# round reply, not a flip, and a predicate that named it would tell the session
# to mark an unanswered round ready-for-review. request-panel.jq already draws
# exactly the line that separates them, in the engine's only copy of it: a
# signal SPENT by verdicts that answered it (#286) requests nobody, so the
# redrafted PR returns empty and #386's untouched signal returns the panel. Ask
# it, and the two cases part on the rule the request gate is already bound by.
#
# It costs one GraphQL read per GREEN-HEADED SIGNALLED draft per tick, which the
# listing cannot serve: the verdicts must be `latestOpinionatedReviews` scoped to
# the head, and `gh pr list --json latestReviews` is ruled out for this question
# (COMMENTED masks a standing blocker and its commit.oid is empty, #147). The
# listing-side gates above it — green, and a valid signal at the head — are what
# keep that call off the ordinary interrupted draft, which is the common case.

# --- The resume gate (#314) -------------------------------------------------
#
# Resume was the one wake in this engine with no doable-work condition: it
# fired whenever `draft_nums` was non-empty, and `draft_nums` is every open
# draft I author, so a correctly PARKED draft woke a full model session every
# tick, forever, with no self-heal and no cap. PR #311 spent 58 sessions at one
# head across 4h45m, each posting a resume marker and a worklog checkpoint and
# committing nothing; the operator disarming the box is what stopped it.
#
# THE BUILDER'S OWN OUTPUT IS NOT A SIGNAL, and that is the whole decision.
# Nothing outside the builder ever spoke on #311, so a naive "anything changed"
# fingerprint would have re-armed itself on each of those 58 markers and
# suppressed nothing — the self-resetting trap LABELS.md already records for the
# staleness sweep ("label churn is not activity … or the sweep would reset
# itself"). Comments and reviews authored by ME are excluded by construction.
#
# THE HEAD GOES IN THE ID, THE TIMESTAMPS GO IN THE VALUE — the ci-red scheme
# (#17), for the reason recorded at that block: ledger_filter re-fires when the
# VALUE sorts greater, and a SHA has no order, so a head carried in the value
# would suppress exactly the corrective push it must wake on. Carried in the id,
# a new head is an id never seen and always fires, which is the issue's "the
# builder's own commits count: a push is progress" without asking a SHA to
# compare. What remains in the value is then all ISO-8601 — foreign comment,
# foreign review, referenced issue, and since #384 the head's newest check
# conclusion — so a lexical max is a chronological one.
#
# THE CHECK TERM BELONGS IN THE VALUE FOR EXACTLY THAT REASON. A conclusion
# stamp is ISO-8601, so it joins the max without disturbing the invariant; and
# it must NOT go in the id, where every re-run of the same check would mint an
# id never seen and fire again on an unchanged tree.

# _resume_pr_fingerprints REPO — stdin is the authored open-PR listing resume
# detection already fetches. One tab-separated line per DRAFT:
#   <repo>#<num>@<head>  <referenced issue or empty>
#
# THE FOREIGN HALF IS NOT READ FROM THE LISTING, and that is not a style choice.
# `gh pr list --json comments,reviews` generates `comments(first: 100)` /
# `reviews(first: 100)` and does not paginate those nested connections, so the
# array is oldest-first and truncated: `max` over it is the newest of the FIRST
# hundred, and it stops moving for good once the thread passes that mark.
# Measured on the incident PR itself — `gh pr list --json number,comments`
# returns exactly 100 for #311, newest returned `2026-08-03T00:05:52Z`, while
# `/issues/311/comments --paginate` has 124. A builder that floods its own PR
# past 100 comments would be left permanently unwakeable by anyone speaking on
# it, which fails this gate's central criterion on precisely the shape it exists
# for. The newest-foreign lookup therefore goes through _resume_newest_foreign
# below, and the listing no longer fetches those fields at all.
#
# The issue reference is read from the BODY, never from the branch name: crew
# branches are `<type>/<issue>-<slug>` and only some are `build/` (#315 is
# `docs/302-rehearsal-remote`). `Closes #N` and `Refs #N` are the two forms
# BUILDER.md writes; the GitHub closing synonyms ride along. `Part of
# owner/repo#N` is deliberately NOT matched — that form is cross-repo, so the
# number does not address an issue in this repo at all — and neither is a bare
# `#N`, because crew bodies cite epics and siblings in prose and the first such
# mention is not the authorizing one. The leading `(^|[^a-z])` is a word
# boundary: without it `the operator discloses #99 in passing` yields issue 99,
# costing a gh call per tick and a WARN naming a wake nobody declared.
#
# THE PATTERN IS A CONSTANT BECAUSE IT HAS TWO CONSUMERS (#479). The structural
# escalation below names the PR's authorizing issue in its operator alert — the
# issue a human should flag `attention` on, which the engine does not write
# itself — and needs the same answer this function derives; a second copy of a
# regex whose every clause was bought by a named failure is a second thing to
# keep true, and the drift would be silent — both copies parse, and only one of
# them is right. It is passed with `--arg` rather than inlined, so each jq
# program stays single-quoted and the pattern is one string in one place.

# _green_head_breaker REPO SLUG ROWS — ROWS is GREEN_HEAD_ROWS. The answer comes
# back in the global GREEN_HEAD_DISPATCH_NUMS, the subset of those PRs the
# green-head bypass may actually resume for this tick. A global for the reason
# _resume_gate states: every report here is a log line and log writes to stdout.
#
# THE BYPASS IS BOUNDED, and this is where (#384, review round 1). The detection
# above holds no state at all, so on its own it would name the same PR every
# tick for as long as the head stood — a resume session every five minutes,
# indefinitely, which is the #314 flood re-entering through the door built to
# end it. That argument is the one this PR already made for the flip-owed lane
# (_resume_gate's RESUME_FORCE_FRESH comment); it is no weaker here, and the
# exposure is larger, because "non-draft, green head, no signal at that head" is
# a shape every PR passes through on the ordinary path between CI concluding and
# its builder signalling.
#
# `_resume_breaker` IS REUSED UNMODIFIED, on the key it already counts by:
# `<repo>#<num>@<head>`, so a push resets the count to one with no separate
# observation, and a PR that stops qualifying drops out of stdin and out of the
# state file.
#
# ITS OWN STATE FILE IS NOT A DETAIL. `_resume_breaker` rebuilds its state from
# stdin alone and `mv`s it into place, so keys absent from a given call are
# pruned — deliberate, and pinned by `resume-breaker-state-prunes`. Two call
# sites sharing `.resume-zero-action.<slug>` would therefore erase each other's
# counters every tick: the gate's drafts are not in this call's stdin and this
# call's PRs are not in the gate's. The lanes get one file each.
#
# SUPPRESSION ENDS THIS BYPASS, NOT THE PR'S CLAIM ON RESUME. A suppressed PR is
# still in `stranded_keys` and its twelve-tick counter still advances untouched,
# but the post-threshold stranded lane now has its own breaker too. Either lane
# may independently dispatch while its own breaker allows it.
#
# A TICK WITH NO ROWS RETURNS EARLY rather than rebuilding an empty state file,
# which is _resume_gate's shape and the breaker's own rule: the count is of
# consecutive DISPATCHES, not consecutive ticks, so a quiet tick in between must
# not silently reset it. Stale keys are pruned by the next tick that has rows.

  # Same treatment for the owed-round signal: a round the session declines to
  # answer is a permanent wake otherwise. number+updatedAt travel so the ledger
  # re-wakes on a push or a new review, which is exactly when it should.
  #
  # A RED HEAD IS NOT A ROUND (#45). The rule is the author's: a review request
  # requires a green check at the head, because a red check is the author's own
  # signal and not the panel's work. Measured on crew#40 — two consecutive
  # heads, four reviewer-rounds, every one relaying a CI failure already visible
  # in the job log. The most expensive of the four opened with "CI is red at
  # this head … that gates my approval" and stopped looking, so the cost is not
  # the wasted round, it is the findings that round did not make.
  #
  # Enforced here rather than left to the prompt. The doctrine belongs in
  # fragment-round-rules.txt as well, and is there — but a rule only a model can
  # apply is a rule that gets dropped under a long context, and this one has to
  # hold for every round of every builder. Nothing is stranded by the exclusion:
  # a red head has already woken the ci-red block above, which is the work that
  # has to happen first regardless.
  #
  # ADMIT `green` OR `none`; HOLD `red` AND `pending` (danmt's ruling, #64).
  #
  # The gate is a whitelist for the same reason `is_green` is: "everything but
  # red" is a fallthrough, and a fallthrough is what the CANCELLED bug was.
  # The three states are three different facts and get three behaviours.
  #
  #   red      HELD, and it is the author's own work. Wakes ci-red above.
  #   pending  HELD, and it is NOT the author's work — it is a check that has
  #            not answered yet. Opening the round now spends the panel on a
  #            head that may go red, which is exactly what #45 measured on
  #            crew#40. Transient by definition: the item re-evaluates next
  #            tick (5 minutes) and admits itself once the check settles
  #            green. Must NOT wake ci-red — nothing has failed.
  #   none     ADMITTED. Terminal, not transient: a repo with no CI configured
  #            is `none` FOREVER, so holding on it means the engine can never
  #            open a review round in that repo at all. head-checks.jq already
  #            rules this a state of its own rather than a not-green one — "a
  #            repo with no CI configured and a repo whose checks all passed
  #            are different facts, and only one of them is evidence."
  #
  # Two holds, two messages. A pending hold that borrowed the red wording
  # ("CI first") would tell the operator the author owes work when the author
  # owes nothing but a wait, and that misreading is the whole distinction the
  # ruling draws.
  #
  # An admitted `none` head still travels into the build prompt: the session is
  # bound by the same green-at-the-head rule, and `none` is the one state where
  # there is no check coming to wait for. Telling it so beats it inferring so.

  # --- HANDOFF: a converged round of mine that owes the human. Convergence
  # computed directly: every panelist's latest opinionated review APPROVES
  # the CURRENT head, no panel request outstanding, PR mergeable RIGHT NOW,
  # state:needs-human not already set (the human is off-panel — without the
  # refire guard this wake fires forever after a successful handoff), and no
  # standing unanswered CHANGES_REQUESTED from the human at that head (#452).
  #
  # THAT LAST TERM IS WHY THE LABEL WAS NOT ENOUGH. The refire guard reads a
  # label the RECONCILER owns, and the reconciler takes it off the moment the
  # human blocks — correctly, the ball is the builder's. Convergence then read
  # true again on the next tick (the panel still approves the head; a verdict
  # does not move mergeable), the handoff re-requested the human and re-set the
  # label, and the reconciler's "an explicit human request outranks the
  # remaining bot outcomes" clause made it stick. The change request never
  # reached the builder and the PR parked back on the human with a fresh nag —
  # the withdrawn-then-re-nagged pair notify.sh shows. The disqualifier is
  # spent by the builder's signal at that head, so an argued answer still
  # converges and still reaches the human.
  #
  # HANDOFF IS DELIBERATELY NOT GATED ON A GREEN HEAD, and the obvious
  # improvement is the bug (grok, #64). Adding `&& check_state == "green"`
  # here reads as symmetry with the round gate above, but the two wakes have
  # opposite failure modes: ci-red fires at most ONCE PER HEAD by design (the
  # ledger id carries the oid), so under a red that no push can clear — a
  # runner outage, a failure already on main — ci-red goes quiet after its one
  # session and a green-gated handoff would then wake nothing at all. That is
  # ceremony#163 exactly: full-panel approvals, mergeable, and stranded, which
  # is the incident #17 was filed from. A converged PR reaching the human with
  # a red check is a human's call to make; a converged PR reaching nobody is
  # the failure this module exists to end. ---

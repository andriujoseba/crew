# duty-hygiene.sh — the backlog-hygiene sweep (triage role, hourly), gated on
# whether the board moved. There is no cheap shell test for "this label is no
# longer true", so the sweep itself stays judgment-only — but whether a sweep
# could find anything at all IS cheap: a label cannot have become untrue if
# nothing on the board changed since the last session looked. The judgment is
# the expensive half and it is still the model's; the trigger is the cheap half
# and it is now a listing (#465).
#
# It stays the backstop for every fail-safe default in duty-triage.sh. Two
# things keep that true rather than nominal: HYGIENE_FLOOR, which sweeps a
# never-changing board anyway because some of what hygiene owns turns on the
# clock and not on the board (a 48h reclaim, a 7-day post-merge nudge, an issue
# the world made obsolete); and a gate that FAILS OPEN — a listing that errors
# or a ledger line that will not parse sweeps and warns, because a budget that
# cannot read its balance must not spend, while a backstop that cannot read the
# board must not stop being the backstop (#59, #464).
#
# shellcheck shell=bash

# The floor's shipped default, in seconds, used only when the loaded role conf
# predates it. Config and engine are installed together, but they can skew
# across an upgrade, and under `set -u` a bare reference would abort the whole
# tick rather than degrade — the wrong direction for a value whose only job is
# to make the sweep MORE frequent. Kept equal to shared/conf/roles/triage.conf,
# and `hygiene-floor-default-matches-conf` fails if the two ever drift.
HYGIENE_FLOOR_DEFAULT=43200

# The cap on the bounded listing. Reaching it means the board is larger than the
# digest can see, so a change past the cap would be invisible — that is a hole,
# not a saving, and it fails open like every other thing this gate cannot read.

# _hygiene_listing REPO — the one bounded read the gate is allowed, and the
# whole of its API cost. Four fields, because the digest is asserted one field
# at a time: `number` catches an issue arriving or (by its absence from an
# open-state listing) closing, `updatedAt` catches a body or comment, `labels`
# catches the queue moves that are this sweep's entire subject, and `assignees`
# catches the claim moves the reclaim clock reads. stderr is NOT swallowed: a
# gate that cannot read the board says why, in the log the operator already has.

# _hygiene_digest — stdin the listing JSON, stdout one digest for the whole
# board. Nonzero if it cannot be computed, INCLUDING when the listing came back
# at the cap: a truncated board is not a board, and the caller sweeps.
#
# `cksum`, not `sha256sum`, for the reason _wt_dirt_id records: this is an
# identity for a local state file, not provenance, and cksum is POSIX, so the
# engine gains no new dependency on a fleet whose boxes differ in what is
# installed. Rows are sorted before hashing so the digest is a property of the
# BOARD and not of the order gh happened to return it in.
#
# THE MULTI-VALUE FIELDS ARE `tojson`, NOT `join(",")`. A separator join is not
# injective over names that may contain the separator: one label named `a,b` and
# two labels named `a` and `b` flatten to the identical field, so two different
# boards digest the same and a real change is suppressed. `updatedAt` sits in
# the same row and GitHub bumps it on every label event, so no live board can
# reach the collision today — but that is a fact about GitHub, not about this
# function, and a fingerprint must not borrow its injectivity from a neighbour.
# `tojson` quotes and escapes each element, so the array is recoverable from the
# field and distinct arrays give distinct fields. Assignees get the same
# treatment: a login cannot contain a comma, and this should not depend on it.

# value sorts GREATER, which is right for a timestamp and wrong for a digest: a
# board that changed into a state whose digest happens to sort below the stored
# one would be suppressed exactly when it moved. _wt_dirt_id answers the same
# problem by putting the fingerprint in the ID and a sentinel in the value —
# correct there, but here it would leave a board that returns to a previous
# state (a label added then removed) matching an id it has already seen, and
# hygiene's whole subject is labels going on and off. So the row is keyed by
# repo and compared for INEQUALITY, which fires in both directions and holds
# one row per repo forever rather than one per state ever seen. The floor needs
# a second field on that row anyway, which the two-field ledger cannot carry.

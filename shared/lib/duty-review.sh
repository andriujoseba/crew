# duty-review.sh — the reviewer wake: outstanding review requests, one
# merged candidate set, verdict dedup by head SHA, re-request auto-approve.
#
# Doctrine (REVIEWER.md / FLEET.md), as amended by danmt 2026-07-25:
#  - repos.txt IS the scope. A review request authorizes a review only in a
#    repo this box carries. The previous rule ("a request anywhere in the org
#    or a fleet fork is authorization; no repo list scopes it") made every
#    box's write surface the entire org, which no registry could bound: the
#    #26 interlock narrows repos.txt and so confined triage and hygiene, but
#    NOT this module. Scope is now the registry.
#    Corrected 2026-07-27 (#52): this note used to claim the interlock also
#    confined ATTENTION. It does not, and never did — duty-attention.sh reads
#    the authenticated-user issues endpoint on purpose, cross-repo, and
#    reaches repos not in repos.txt. That inaccuracy mattered: it is the kind
#    of claim that reads like coverage, which is the whole complaint #52 was
#    filed about. drill/rehearsal-safety.sh now checks attention separately
#    rather than assuming repos.txt bounds it.
#  - Awareness is still org-wide, but it never acts. One search query per
#    tick reports requests outside the registry, so the failure mode the old
#    rule existed to prevent (cast#143: a converged round sat unowed for 40
#    minutes) surfaces as a logged line instead of silence. If one of those
#    matters, the repo belongs in repos.txt — that is an operator decision,
#    not something a sweep should make by writing to a repo nobody listed.
#  - Truth comes from object endpoints (pulls API, pulls/N/reviews). The
#    SEARCH index lags — it caused missed wakes (cast#143, box#164, rig#112,
#    nine hours) and double reviews (#26, #29). Search only ADDS candidates.
#  - ONE candidate set, merged and deduped by (repo, PR) BEFORE acting —
#    sequential source passes double-announced on ceremony#32 (grok + kimi).
#  - requested_reviewers self-clears on submit, but only when a verdict lands.
#    A completed session may correctly decline or fail its one-shot submit, so
#    unchanged requests also pass through a seen-ledger (#61). A changed PR
#    advances updated_at and wakes again.
#
# shellcheck shell=bash
# shellcheck disable=SC2016  # single-quoted GraphQL/jq programs with $vars are intended

# Repos where I author an open PR — read off the sweep's own pulls pages at
# zero extra API cost (claude-bot's cast#143 fix). Consumed by duty-builder.

#                  re-request arrived over a STANDING non-approval
#                  (CHANGES_REQUESTED / DISMISSED) at an unchanged head. A live
#                  block is not a stale verdict: only a real re-review can judge
#                  whether it was resolved in-thread, so never auto-approve it.
#   auto-approve — my standing APPROVED covers this head and a newer re-request
#                  arrived. ceremony#94's operator ruling: a stale approval must

# duty-triage.sh — the triage wake signals, per repo in repos.txt, in the
# order they run:
#   (d) unread mentions (one tick-wide session, and it goes FIRST)
#   (a) needs-triage issues        (b) queue-unlabeled strays
#   (c) discussions without my voice
#   (e) blocked issues whose named blockers all landed (a LEAD, not a verdict)
#   (f) declared predecessors whose state changed (a LEAD, not a verdict)
#
# The board poll follows the mention session because that session can run for
# TIMEOUT_MENTION (25 minutes) and can itself change the board: polled first,
# the launch decision is made on a snapshot up to 25 minutes stale, which
# spends a triage session on leads that died mid-session and defers a signal
# born during it by a full tick (#253).
#
# Architectural spine (dan-claude-bot): this module only ever WAKES a
# session — it never edits a label itself. A parser bug becomes a false lead
# the session rejects, not a wrong board write. Every signal is fail-safe:
# (e)'s unknown blocker counts as still-open, and the hourly hygiene sweep
# is the unconditional backstop for anything detection misses.
#
# Every board read is isolated per signal per repo: one transient API failure
# degrades to a logged skip, never an aborted tick (the old duty.sh died
# mid-queue on the first failure, silently skipping every later repo). The
# notifications read is deliberately tick-wide: one snapshot feeds every repo.

# --- #503: round count as sizing evidence, in front of triage ---------------
#
# Doctrine names round growth as evidence for the NEXT mint (`TRIAGE.md`
# `## Sizing`, ceremony#419), and the cap it is read against is five. The engine
# already counts rounds, but only in the shape D1 calls insufficient:
# `_round_cap_census` in duty-builder.sh, per PR, over OPEN authored PRs, and
# interesting exactly when one stalls. This is the other reading of the same
# number — per issue, over the whole history, as a distribution — put in front
# of the agent that makes the sizing judgement.
#
# IT IS CONTEXT, NOT A SIGNAL, AND THAT IS THE POINT OF D4. "No automatic
# action. This surfaces evidence." A wake IS an action: it spends a model
# session. And a distribution moves whenever any PR anywhere gains a round, so
# as a wake it would re-fire on an unchanged board every tick forever — #59's
# defect exactly, on a signal that can never clear itself because there is
# nothing for a session to DO about it. So this runs only where a triage session
# is ALREADY launching, below the `signals` early return: a quiet tick pays
# nothing, and every tick that could act on the evidence carries it.
#
# It writes no label, opens and closes nothing, and gates no dispatch. Its only
# effect on the tick is one prompt slot.
#
# COST. One paginated GraphQL call per page of PRs, per triage session — not per
# tick. Closed PRs are in the query because D5 requires them: "history is
# included, or the first reading is meaningless".
#
# A FETCH FAILURE COSTS THE EVIDENCE AND NOTHING ELSE. Every warn returns with
# ROUND_COUNT_EVIDENCE empty, the fragment is omitted, and the session runs on
# the signals that woke it. Sizing evidence is an input to a human-grade
# judgement, and a partial distribution would be a wrong one presented as
# measured — so a page that fails discards the read rather than reporting a
# board that is missing its oldest PRs.
ROUND_COUNT_EVIDENCE=""

# _triage_round_count REPO — set ROUND_COUNT_EVIDENCE to the rendered fragment.
#
# THE ISSUE PATTERN IS duty-builder.sh's `_RESUME_ISSUE_RE`, referenced and not
# restated. That constant's own header gives the reason: "a second copy of a
# regex whose every clause was bought by a named failure is a second thing to
# keep true, and the drift would be silent — both copies parse, and only one of
# them is right" (#479). Reaching across duty modules for it is deliberate and
# safe: bin/duty.sh sources all four unconditionally, before any role dispatch,
# so the constant is defined on a triage-only box too — pinned by a case in
# shared/test/triage.sh so a later reordering cannot silently empty it.
#
# THE CAP IS READ FROM round-cap.jq, never restated here. "THE CAP IS A LITERAL
# HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE" (#502 D1), so the distribution is read against five by
# asking the program that owns the five, on an empty payload.

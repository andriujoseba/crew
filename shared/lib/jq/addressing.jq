# addressing.jq — round-close predicate, the deliberate MIRROR of converged.jq
# (#130). Input: the GraphQL pullRequest payload (headRefOid, labels,
# reviewRequests, latestOpinionatedReviews). Args: $panel (JSON array of
# logins, author already subtracted), $addressing (label name).
#
# Output, one word:
#   true   the round closed WITHOUT full approval — the builder's ball; set
#          state:addressing
#   false  not a closed-without-approval round (still awaiting a verdict,
#          already converged, or the label already stands)
#
# The two predicates share every input and every scoping rule and differ only
# in the conclusion, on purpose: converged.jq asks "did every panelist approve
# THIS head?", addressing.jq asks "did every panelist review THIS head and at
# least one NOT approve?". Writing them as sibling fixtures against the same
# payload is what keeps them from drifting into two hand-rolled round
# predicates that can disagree — a defect waiting to be filed (#130).
#
# Computed from latestOpinionatedReviews, never reviewDecision (empty without
# branch protection — stalled rounds for a day, ceremony#26/#39). Reviews must
# be AT the current head: an opinion is of a specific tree, and a verdict on a
# superseded head has not reviewed the tree the panel is being asked about.

# Mirror of converged.jq's $not_handed: the engine write is optimistic and the
# add-label is itself idempotent, but gating the predicate on the label being
# ABSENT is what makes "re-ticking writes nothing" true at the jq layer rather
# than relying on GitHub to no-op a redundant PUT (#130 acceptance criterion).

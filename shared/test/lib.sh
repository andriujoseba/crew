# A pipeline inside a quoted payload handed to a remote shell — bxn, or box
# exec … bash -lc — runs where this file's pipefail is not in effect, so grep's
# status is the pipeline's status and the shape is outside the class. #449 keys
# that exemption to the shape rather than to a filename: cli/crew is a
# candidate now, and its payload site is exempt for the reason the
# rehearsal-app.sh ones are, not for where it lives.
#
# The exemption is bounded twice, and both bounds are load-bearing.
#
# It ends where the payload does. Rather than asking whether a line carrying a
# payload has a pipe somewhere after it, blank the payload bodies out and read
# what is left: that residue is what this file's own shell runs, and this
# file's pipefail is the one the guard is about. A local pipeline sharing a
# line with a payload — before it, after its closing quote, or wrapped around
# it — therefore stays in the class.
#
# It begins only at a real invocation. The residue is built by one left-to-
# right scan that tracks quote state, so the only quotes ever tested as payload
# openers are the ones at an unquoted position, and a quote can open a payload
# only when the text scanned before it ends in bash -lc or bxn <arg>. Matching
# opener-shaped text anywhere on the line would read the " in
# `echo 'bash -lc "'` as an opener, find no mate, and swallow that line's
# actual pipeline as an unterminated payload — the silent pass this guard
# exists to prevent (#451 rounds 1 and 2).

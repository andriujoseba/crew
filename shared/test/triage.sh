# --- #358: post-merge is a queue label, and the engine's set is LABELS.md's -
# LABELS.md declares a SIX-label board invariant; fleet.defaults.conf defined
# five and signal (b) selected on those five. So the moment triage did its job
# — a Refs-linked PR merges, the issue moves claimed -> post-merge — it turned
# that issue into a permanent violation of the engine's own invariant, one no
# session could ever clear because post-merge is the correct terminal state.
# All four live matches on this board were that false positive.
#
# Both directions are driven through the real module and the same shim: the
# select is proven by what it selects, never by reading it. The label values
# reach the module from the SHIPPED conf (see the TRD/conf copy above), so a
# label the engine's config does not define cannot pass here.
